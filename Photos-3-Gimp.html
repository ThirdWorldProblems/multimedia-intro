<h3>The Interface</h3>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Overview</span><br>
<img alt="Screenshot of the GIMP in action" src="PhotoScreen/GimpScreenshot.jpg">
<div class="orderedlist">
<p> The screenshot above shows the most basic arrangement of <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> windows that can be used effectively. </p>
<ol type="1"><li>
    <p> <span class="emphasis"><em>The Main Toolbox:</em></span>
Contains a set of icon buttons used to select tools. It may also
contain
the foreground and background colors; brush, pattern, and Gradient; and
an icon of the active image. Use <span class="guimenu">Edit</span>
-&gt; <span class="guisubmenu">Preferences</span> -&gt; <span class="guisubmenu">Toolbox</span> to enable, or disable the extra
items. </p>
  </li><li>
    <p> <span class="emphasis"><em>Tool options:</em></span> Docked
below the main Toolbox is a Tool Options dialog, showing options for
the currently selected tool (in this case, the paintbrush tool). </p>
  </li><li>
    <p> <span class="emphasis"><em>An image window:</em></span> Each
image open in <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> is displayed in
a separate window. Many images can be open at the same time, limited by
only the system resources. Before you can do anything useful in <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>, you need to have at least one image
window open. The image window holds the Menu of the main commands of <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> (File, Edit, Select...), which you can
also get by right-clicking on the window. </p>
  </li><li>
    <p> The <span class="emphasis"><em>Layers, Channels, Paths</em></span>
dock with the Layers Dialog open; note that there are several tabs at
the top of area, each of these is a different dialog. This dialog
window that is open shows the layer structure of the currently active
image, and allows it to be manipulated in a variety of ways. It is
possible to do a few very basic things without using the Layers dialog,
but even moderately sophisticated <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>
users find it indispensable to have the Layers dialog available at all
times. </p>
  </li><li>
    <p> <span class="emphasis"><em>Brushes/Patterns/Gradients:</em></span>
The docked dialog below the layer dialog shows the dialogs (tabs) for
managing brushes, patterns and gradients. </p>
  </li></ol>
</div>
<p> This is a minimal setup. There are over a dozen other types of
dialogs used by <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> for various
purposes, but users typically open them when they need them and close
them when they are done. Knowledgeable users generally keep the Toolbox
(with Tool Options) and Layers dialog open at all times. The Toolbox is
essential to many <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> operations;
in fact, if you close it, <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> will
exit after confirming that that is actually what you want to do. The
Tool Options section is actually a separate dialog, shown docked to the
Main Toolbox in the screenshot. Knowledgeable users almost always have
it set up this way: it is very difficult to use tools effectively
without being able to see how their options are set. The Layers dialog
comes into play when you work with an image with multiple layers: after
you advance beyond the most basic stages of <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>
expertise, this means <span class="emphasis"><em>almost always</em></span>.
And of course it helps to display the images you're editing on the
screen; if you close the image window before saving your work, <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> will ask you whether you want to close
the file. <br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Image Window</span><br>
</p>
<p><img src="PhotoScreen/imagewindow-description.png" alt="GIMP Image Window"></p>
<br>
<div class="orderedlist">
<p> An image window exists, even if no image is open. The Title Bar in
an image window without an image reads <span class="quote">"<span class="quote">GNU Image Manipulating Program</span>"</span>. An image
window with an image displays the image name and its specifications in
the title bar according to the settings in <span class="link">Preference
Dialog</span>. Each window displays exactly one image, or no image if
no image is open. Each image is displayed in one or more image windows;
it is unusual to display the same image in more than one window. We
will begin with a brief description of the components that are present
by default in an ordinary image window. Some of the components can be
removed by using commands in the <span class="link">View</span> menu. </p>
<ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
    <p> <span class="emphasis"><em>Title Bar:</em></span> The top of
the image window typically displays a Title Bar with the name of the
image and some basic information about the image. The Title Bar is
provided by the operating system, not by <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>,
so its appearance is likely to vary with the operating system, window
manager, and/or theme. Use the <span class="link">Preferences dialog</span>
to customize the information that appears in the Title Bar. </p>
  </li><li class="listitem">
    <p> <span class="emphasis"><em>Image Menu:</em></span> Directly
below the Title Bar appears the Image Menu (unless it has been
suppressed). The Image Menu provides access to nearly every operation
you can perform on an image. You can also right-click on an image to
display a pop-up image menu, or by left-clicking on the little&nbsp;<span class="quote"><span class="quote">arrow</span></span> symbol in the
upper left corner, called the <span class="emphasis"><em>Menu Button:</em></span>,
if for some reason you find one of these more convenient. Many menu
commands are also associated with keyboard <span class="emphasis"><em>shortcuts</em></span>
as shown in the menu. You can define your own custom shortcuts for menu
actions, if you enable <span class="link"> Use Dynamic Keyboard
Shortcuts</span> in the Preferences dialog. </p>
  </li><li class="listitem">
    <p> <span class="emphasis"><em>Menu Button:</em></span> Click the
Menu Button to display the Image Menu in a column. If you like to use
keyboard shortcuts, use <span class="keycap"><strong>Shift</strong></span>+<span class="keycap"><strong>F10</strong></span> to open the menu. </p>
  </li><li class="listitem">
    <p> <span class="emphasis"><em>Ruler:</em></span> In the default
layout, rulers are shown above and to the left of the image. Use the
rulers to determine coordinates within the image. The default unit for
rulers is pixels; use the settings described below to use a unit other
than pixels. </p>
    <p> One of the most important uses of rulers is to create <span class="emphasis"><em>guides</em></span>. Click and drag a ruler into
the image to create a guide. A guide is a line that helps you
accurately position things or verify that another line is truly
horizontal or vertical. Click and drag a guide to move it. Drag a guide
out of the image to delete it; you can always drag another guide into
the image. You can even use multiple guides at the same time. </p>
  </li><li class="listitem">
    <p> <span class="emphasis"><em>QuickMask Toggle:</em></span> The
small button in the lower left corner of the image toggles the Quick
Mask on and off. When the Quick Mask is on, the button is outlined in
red. See <span class="link">QuickMask</span> in the GIMP manual for
more details on this highly useful tool. </p>
  </li><li class="listitem">
    <p> <span class="emphasis"><em>Pointer Coordinates:</em></span>
When the pointer (mouse cursor, if you are using a mouse) is within the
image boundaries, the rectangular area in the lower left corner of the
window displays the current pointer coordinates. The units are the same
as for the rulers. </p>
  </li><li class="listitem">
    <p> <span class="emphasis"><em>Units Menu:</em></span> Use the
Units Menu to change the units used for rulers and several other
purposes. The default unit is pixels, but you can quickly change to
inches, cm, or several other possibilities using this menu. Note that
the setting of <span class="quote">"<span class="quote">Dot for dot"</span></span>
in the View menu affects how the display is scaled: see <span class="link">Dot for Dot</span> in the GIMP manual for more
information. </p>
  </li><li class="listitem">
    <p> <span class="emphasis"><em>Zoom Button:</em></span> There are
a number of ways to zoom the image in or out, but the Zoom Button is
perhaps the simplest. With GIMP-2.6, you can directly enter a zoom
level in the text box for very fine control. </p>
  </li><li class="listitem">
    <p> <span class="emphasis"><em>Status Area:</em></span> The Status
Area is at the bottom of the image window. By default, the Status Area
displays the active part of the image, and the amount of system memory
used by the image. Use <span class="guimenu">Edit</span> -&gt; <span class="guisubmenu">Preferences</span> -&gt; <span class="guimenuitem">Image
Windows</span> -&gt; <span class="guimenuitem">Title &amp; Status</span>
to customize the information displayed in the Status Area. During
time-consuming operations, the status area temporarily shows the
running operation and how complete the operation is.<br>
    <br>
Note that the memory used by the image is very different from the image
file size. For instance, a 70Kb .PNG image may occupy 246Kb in memory
when displayed. There are two primary reasons the difference in memory
usage. First, a .PNG file is compressed format, and the image is
reconstituted in memory in uncompressed form. Second, <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> uses extra memory, and copies of the
image, for use by the Undo command.</p>
  </li><li class="listitem">
    <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Cancel Button:</em></span> During
complex time-consuming operations, usually a plug-in, a Cancel button
temporarily appears in the lower right corner of the window. Use the
Cancel button to stop the operation.</p>
  </li><li class="listitem">
    <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Navigation Control:</em></span> This
is a small cross-shaped button at the lower right corner of the image
display. Click and hold (do not release the mouse button) on the
navigation control to display the Navigation Preview. The Navigation
Preview has a miniature view of the image with the displayed area
outlined. Use the Navigation Preview To quickly pan to a different part
of the image move the mouse while keeping the button depressed. The
Navigation Window is often the most convenient way to quickly navigate
around a large image with only a small portion displayed. (See <span class="link">Navigation Dialog</span> for other ways to access the
Navigation Window). (If your mouse has a middle-button, click-drag with
it to pan across the image). </p>
  </li><li class="listitem">
    <p> <span class="emphasis"><em>Inactive Padding Area:</em></span>
This padding area separates the active image display and the inactive
padding area, so you're able to distinguish between them. You cannot
apply any Filters or Operations in general to the inactive area. </p>
  </li><li class="listitem">
    <p> <span class="emphasis"><em>Image Display:</em></span> The most
important part of the image window is, of course, the image display or
canvas. It occupies the central area of the window, surrounded by a
yellow dotted line showing the image boundary, against a neutral gray
background. You can change the zoom level of the image display in a
variety of ways, including the Zoom setting described below. </p>
  </li><li class="listitem">
    <p> <span class="emphasis"><em>Image Window Resize Toggle:</em></span>
Without enabling this feature, if you change the size of the image
window, the image size and zoom does not change. If you make the window
larger, for example, then you will see more of the image. If this
button is pressed, however, the image resizes when the window resizes
so that (mostly) the same portion of the image is displayed before and
after the window is resized.</p>
  </li></ol>
</div>
Drag and drop an image into the Toolbox window to open the image in its
own Image window. This is very different than dragging an image into an
existing Image window, which adds it to the currently open image in a
new layer usually not what you want.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Undoing</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span>
<p> Almost anything you do to an image in <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>
can be undone. You can undo the most recent action by choosing <span class="guimenu">Edit</span> -&gt; <span class="guimenuitem">Undo</span>
from the image menu, but this is done so frequently that you really
should memorize the keyboard shortcut, <span class="keycap"><strong>Ctrl</strong></span>+<span class="keycap"><strong>Z</strong></span>. </p>
<p> Undoing can itself be undone. After having undone an action, you
can <span class="emphasis"><em>redo</em></span> it by choosing <span class="guimenu">Edit</span> -&gt; <span class="guimenuitem">Redo</span>
from the image menu, or use the keyboard shortcut, <span class="keycap"><strong>Ctrl</strong></span>+<span class="keycap"><strong>Y</strong></span>. It is often helpful to judge
the effect of an action by repeatedly undoing and redoing it. This is
usually very quick, and does not consume any extra resources or alter
the undo history, so there is never any harm in it.</p>
<p> If you undo one or more actions and then operate on the image in
any way except by using Undo or Redo, it will no longer be possible to
redo those actions: they are lost forever. The solution to this, if it
creates a problem for you, is to duplicate the image and then test on
the copy. ( Do <span class="emphasis"><em>Not</em></span> test the
original, because the undo/redo history is not copied when you
duplicate an image.)</p>
<p>If you often find yourself undoing and redoing many steps at a time,
it may be more convenient to work with the <span class="link">Undo
History dialog</span>, a dockable dialog that shows you a small sketch
of each point in the Undo History, allowing you to go back or forward
to that point by clicking. </p>
Undo is performed on an image-specific basis: the "Undo History" is one
of the components of an image. <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>
allocates a certain amount of memory to each image for this purpose.
You can customize your Preferences to increase or decrease the amount,
using the <span class="link">Environment</span> page of the
Preferences dialog. There are two important variables: the <span class="emphasis"><em>minimal number of undo levels</em></span>, which <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> will maintain regardless of how much
memory they consume, and the <span class="emphasis"><em>maximum undo
memory</em></span>, beyond which <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>
will begin to delete the oldest items from the Undo History.
<p><acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>'s implementation of Undo is
rather sophisticated. Many operations require very little Undo memory
(e.g., changing visibility of a layer), so you can perform long
sequences of them before they drop out of the Undo History. Some
operations, such as changing layer visibility, are <span class="emphasis"><em>compressed</em></span>, so that doing them
several times in a row produces only a single point in the Undo
History. However, there are other operations that may consume a lot of
undo memory. Most filters are implemented by plug-ins, so the <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> core has no efficient way of knowing
what changed. As such, there is no way to implement Undo except by
memorizing the entire contents of the affected layer before and after
the operation. You might only be able to perform a few such operations
before they drop out of the Undo History. </p>
Most actions that alter an image can be undone. Actions that do not
alter the image generally cannot be undone. Examples include saving the
image to a file, duplicating the image, copying part of the image to
the clipboard, etc. It also includes most actions that affect the image
display without altering the underlying image data. The most important
example is zooming. There are, however, exceptions: toggling QuickMask
on or off can be undone, even though it does not alter the image data.
<p> There are a few important actions that do alter an image but cannot
be undone, specifically: Closing the Image, Reverting the Image, and
"Pieces" of Actions. </p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Opening and Saving an Image</span><br>
Here we will use the GIMP to open, modify and save our image.&nbsp; For
starters, let's grab an image, right click on <a href="PhotoExamples/Open-Ex-small.jpg">this image link</a>, and
select the option to save it to the disk. <br>
<br>
Now, let's open up the GIMP program.&nbsp; Once it is open, use the
File-&gt;Open... command to bring up the File Open dialog.&nbsp; Select
the file that you just saved to the disk an click the "Open"
button.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Your screen should now look something like this.<br>
<br>
<img src="PhotoScreen/OpenImage.jpg" alt="OpenImage.jpg"><br>
<br>
Congratulations...you're successfully using the GIMP!<br>
<br>
Now, let's do something to the image, and save it as a different file.<br>
<br>
Click the paintbrush button:<br>
<img src="PhotoScreen/SelectPaint.jpg" alt="SelectPaint.jpg"><br>
<br>
Now go ahead and draw something on top of the image...don't worry about
what it looks like.&nbsp; If you want to start over, use the "Revert"
command.&nbsp; Simply click File -&gt; Revert.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<img src="PhotoExamples/Open-Ex-color.jpg" alt="Open-Ex-color.jpg"><br>
<br>
Now that we're done drawing, we want to save it, but we don't want to
overwrite the original file.&nbsp; So, we're going to go to File -&gt;
Save As... and pick a new name and a location to save to on the
disk.&nbsp; Be sure that the file name ends in .jpg (or .jpeg) so that
the GIMP knows how to save it correctly.&nbsp; Then click the save
button.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Now you will see a dialog asking what quality you want your image to be
saved at. The higher the number, the less data is lost during the lossy
compression and the larger the file.&nbsp; Lower numbers will give you
smaller files, but will cause the image to look bad!&nbsp; To help
figure out what kind of trade-off between size and quality you should
make, click the box for "Show preview in image window".&nbsp; You may
have to drag that dialog or the "Save Image" dialog out of the way to
see your image as the preview is applied.&nbsp; When you're happy with
it, click the save button.<br>
<br>
Here's an example of setting the quality very low, which makes the
preview image look terrible....I didn't save it like this!<br>
<br>
<img src="PhotoScreen/SaveOptions.jpg" alt="SaveOptions.jpg"><br>
<br>
Congratulations, you're well on your way to working with photos in the
GIMP!
