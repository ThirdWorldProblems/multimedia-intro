<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>This course is an introduction to creation of multimedia
works.&nbsp; It will focus on five parts: Photos, Graphics, Audio,
Video, and Websites.&nbsp; Because of the huge scope of these topics,
each one will only be covered in an introductury manner.&nbsp; The goal
of this course is to give the students enough of an introduction to the
topics, that they could go on and learn more advanced concepts on their
own.&nbsp; <br>
</p>

<h2 class="western">About this Material</h2>

<p>This material was originally developed for the Instituto San Jose
in Montero, Bolivia for a course covering an introduction to
multimedia design. The original course was in Spanish, but as the
teacher was a native English speaker, the materials were first
prepared in English, then translated to Spanish. </p>

<h2 class="western">Free Software</h2>

<p>Throughout this course, we will attempt to use, where possible, Free
and Open Source software.&nbsp; Free or Open Source (the terms are
often used interchangeably) software is software that is distributed
under a specific license that allows others to examine, modify, and
distribute without having to ask additional permission of the original
author.&nbsp; This keeps any one company from controlling the software,
and allows huge communities of participants to work together, adding
important features that make the software useful for themselves and
others.&nbsp; Because this software is open to the community, it is
also almost always distributed without monetary cost.&nbsp; All the
free software used in this course can be freely downloaded from various
websites.&nbsp; <br>
</p>

<p>That said, this course is primarily about the multimedia aspects,
not the software aspects.&nbsp; As such, we will also be covering the
use of non-free (propriatary) tools.&nbsp; The general method used in
this course is to learn the basics of each topic using the open source
tools, then once a basic understanding of the topic is had, the course
will briefly spend time learning how to apply those concepts in the
propriatary tools for that topic. <br>
</p>

<p>Open Source tools we'll be using.&nbsp; Hover over the Icon to read
a short description, click the icon to go to the tool's website.<br>

<p> </p>

<p>In addition, for some of this class, we will be running computers
that use the Ubuntu Operating System, instead of Microsoft
Windows.&nbsp; Ubuntu is an open source replacement for Microsoft
Windows.&nbsp; However, it also does much more than Windows, as it
comes by default with much more software, such as many of the tools
above, and almost all Free/Open Source software can be installed in it
simply by searching in the "Software Center" and clicking install.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/"><img title="Ubuntu Operating System and Software Installer" style="border: 0px solid ; width: 82px; height: 82px;" src="AppIcons/200px-UbuntuCoF.svg.png" alt="200px-UbuntuCoF.svg.png"></a></p>

<h2 class="western">English and Spanish Usage (only in Spanish
document)</h2>

<p>Because all of the tools we will be using in this course are
written and primarily used by English speaking people, many important
resources in print and on the Internet are only available in English.
For this reason, we will make a concerted effort to teach the
english vocabulary for these tools along side the spanish as we go
through the course.</p>

<div>
<h2 class="western"><span>Numbers</span></h2>
</div>

<p>We will be using US format numbers throught this document, as they
are what is generally used in the external documentation that this is
based upon.&nbsp; Commas represent thousands, millions, billions,
etc.&nbsp; Periods represent decimal numbers.<br>
</p>

<p>One Thousand (10^3) = 1,000<br>
One Million (10^6) = 1,000,000</p>

<p>One Tenth (1/10) = 0.1<br>
One Quarter (1/4) = 0.25<br>
</p>

<h2 class="western">File Size</h2>

<p>In computer terminology the basic unit of data is the bit. It is
either a 1 or a 0, and enough bits put together can represent any
data in the computer. </p>

<p>A byte is a collection of bits, 8 bits to be precise. This is the
standard unit that will be used to say how much space a piece of data
takes up. (e.g. that text file is 300 Bytes large, that picture is 2
million bytes, etc)</p>

<p>Because computers can use HUGE numbers of bytes for different
things, we have a set of prefixes that we use to talk about groups of
bytes:</p>

<p>1 Byte</p>

<p>100 Bytes</p>

<p>1,000 Bytes = 1 Kilo Byte (KB)</p>

<p>1,000,000 Bytes = 1,000 KB = 1 Mega Byte (MB)</p>

<p>1,000,000,000 Bytes = 1,000 MB = 1 Giga Byte (GB)</p>

<p>1,000,000,000,000 Bytes = 1,000 GB = 1 Tera Byte (TB)</p>

<p>1,000,000,000,000,000 Bytes = 1,000 TB = 1 Peta Byte (PB)</p>

<p>However, it is important to note that computers don't think of
things in terms of even powers of 10. Instead the computer uses
powers of two, and it just so happens that 2^10 (two to the power of
10) is approximately equal to 1,000 (actually 1024) and 2^20 is
approximately equal to 1,000,000 (actually 1,048,576). Although for
our human heads, its generally easy to think in the simple powers of
ten, just remember that these are not exact!</p>

<h2 class="western">Attribution</h2>

This is a class that deals with editing media works, not creating
originals.&nbsp; As such we generally will not be taking photos,
filming video, capturing audio, etc.&nbsp; For most of the work in this
class, we will be using examples prepared specifically for the
course.&nbsp; However, we may also use material found on the
internet.&nbsp; <br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">For all source material used the
student MUST provide attribute the usage to the original source.</span>&nbsp;
This is done in the following format, with each piece of data seperated by commas:<br>

<br>
[Name or Description of Material], [Author's Name or the words "No author
could be identified"], [the source of the media], [the license that allows
you to use this media]<br>

<br>

For example<br>
<ul>
  <li>
Inkscape Icon, CyberSkull, <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Inkscape_OS_X.png">http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Inkscape_OS_X.png</a>,

  <li>Winter Princess, Zero Project, http://www.jamendo.com/en/track/516729, CC-BY-SA<br>
  </li>
</ul>

Name/Description - This is usually something that can be found easily
if you download the material from the internet.&nbsp; If one is not
available, or if you have two different peices of material with the
same name in your project, write something that will describe it
uniquely.<br>
Author's Name - This is generally found with the material if you are
downloading it from the web.&nbsp; This can be an individual (Thomas
Kent), a screen name (teeks99), or a group/orginization (NASA).&nbsp;
If you are not able to find an author for your material, you may put
the words "No author could be identified" here. <br>
License - This is probably the most important part.&nbsp; This is where
you identify why it is allowable for you to use this material in your
project.&nbsp; See more on licenses in the next section.<br>
<br>
It is essential that all material used in this course have an attribution that is submitted with the project.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Any projects that have material which is not correctly attributed will have credit deducted. </span><br>
<h3 class="western">
Licenses</h3>
All media that is created is immediately and automatically granted a
copyright to the creator of that material (also called a "creative
work" or just "work").&nbsp; This copyright allows the author to
control the use of that creative work by requiring that anyone who
wants to use the work have a license for that work.&nbsp; If the work
is used without a license, the author can sue the person who used it
illegally for hundreds of times the amount that the work is valued
at.&nbsp; Because of this, it is essential that you have a license to
use any works that you incorporate into your projects during this
course.&nbsp; In addition, and projects that you do will automatically
be copyrighted to you!&nbsp; However, as the teacher, I will require
you license the works to me for use in grading and use in class.<br>
<br>
Because it would be very difficult to contact the author directly every
time you need to use material in your creative works, there are a set
of licenses that are setup that authors can attach to a work that allow
anybody to re-use them in ceritan ways.&nbsp; These licenses are
generally called "Creative Commons" Licenses, and are administered by
the Creative Commons orginization.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
The Creative Commons licenses share a set of four basic components (plus a few more for special cases):<br>
<table style="border-spacing: 1em;">

<br>These components are combined together to create a creative commons
license.&nbsp; The important ones and their abbreviations are:<br>
Attribution (CC-BY)<br>
Attribution - Share Alike (CC-BY-SA)<br>
Attribution - Noncommercial (CC-BY-NC)<br>
Attribution - Share Alike - Noncommercial (CC-BY-SA-NC)<br>
Attribution - No Derivative (CC-BY-ND)&nbsp; (Note, this one probably can't be used in this course)<br>
<br>
In addition to these creative commons licenses, some media content is
also made available under licenses generally used by open source
software.<br>
GNU General Public Licnense (GPL) - This requires that if you use the
work in your work, you make your work available under the GPL as well.<br>
GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) - You may use works licensed
under this in your work, however if you make changes to the original
work they must be made available under the LGPL.<br>
Apache/MIT - Same as the LGPL<br>

<h1 class="western">Unit One - Photos</h1>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Tools: Gimp, Photoshop, Picasa</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Goals: Cropping/Re-sizing, Red-Eye
removal, Layers, Image Contrast, Skin Corrections</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Time: 15hrs</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br>
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">For this unit we will learn some basics
about digital images and photos, then some simple photo editing in
the GNU Image Manipulation Program (Gimp), finally we will explore
Photoshop to see how to do the same things, where available. </p>

<h2 class="western">Photos</h2>

<p>Photo files are stored in what is called a "raster" format. This
means that the image is composed of a grid of points (in rows
and columns). These points are called pixels, and they contain the
color for that point. The number of rows and columns that make up
the grid are called the dimensions. A picture that has 33 Columns
(width) and 22 Rows (height) has dimensions of 33x22, and has a total
of 726 pixels. In general the dimensions of digital images are
always written in the form of "width x height".</p>

<img src="RasterGraphics/SmileDimensions.png" alt="SmileDimensions.png"><br>

<p>Modern digital cameras have much, much higher dimensions. They
are often referred based on how many <b>millions</b><span style="font-weight: normal;">
of pixels or "megapixels" they have. Some examples are:</span></p>

<p style="font-weight: normal;">640x480 = 307200 pixels = 0.3
megapixels<br>
1024x768 = 786432 pixels = 0.8 megapixels<br>
1280x960 =
1228800 pixels = 1.2 megapixels <br>
1600x1200 = 1920000 pixels = 1.9
megapixels<br>
2842x2136 = 6070512 pixels = 6 megapixels<br>
4000x3000
= 12000000 pixels = 12 megapixels</p>

<p style="font-weight: normal;">Looking at all these, they have
something in common, if the first number is divided by the second
number, they all approximately equal 1.33. The lowest ratio that
equals 1.33 is 4/3, so this format of images is said to have a 4:3
ratio. </p>

<img src="RasterGraphics/FourThirdsFormula.png" alt="FourThirdsFormula.png"><br>

<p style="font-weight: normal;">This is usually the standard for
photography, other resolutions will be looked at more in the video
unit. </p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2D_computer_graphics">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2D_computer_graphics</a></p>

<p>The reason that cameras have grown the number of megapixels they
use, is because that (with everything else being equal) larger
dimensions make the image look better, especially when you print it
out. A good printer can print photographs at 4800 dots per inch or
dpi. In this case "inches" (1in = 2.45cm) and "dots" (equal
to a pixel) are used because of their history in the printing
industry. </p>

<p>This means that a 12 megapixel image (4000x3000) could be printed
out to a 2.1x1.6cm image and every pixel would be visible. </p>

<img src="RasterGraphics/WidthDPIFormula.png" alt="WidthDPIFormula.png"><img src="RasterGraphics/HeightDPIFormula.png" alt="HeightDPIFormula.png"><br>

<p>However, if it were printed to a 4.2x3.2cm image, then every pixel
would be represented by four dots on the paper. If the sizes were
doubled again to 8.4x6.4cm then every pixel would be represented by
16 dots on the paper. This starts to become a problem when you have
an image without that many pixels in it and want to print (or display
it on a screen) as a large image. At some point, the individual
pixels become easily visible on the printed image, and that can give
it a very blocky and unnatural feeling. </p>

<p>The pictures below are both the same piece of an large image taken
of a tortoise. The photo on the top is from the full size 12
megapixel (4000x3000) image. The photo on the bottom was taken at a
much lower dimension of 640x480. Notice how the pixels of the image
are clearly visible in the lower image and it doesn't look clear.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="RasterGraphics/LargeTortoise-cropped.jpg" alt="LargeTortoise-cropped.jpg"><br>
<br>
<img src="RasterGraphics/LargeTortoise-small-cropped.jpg" alt="LargeTortoise-small-cropped.jpg"><br>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>As a rule of thumb, it is important to keep the best possible
image (most pixels), at least while working with it to edit. The
section on cropping and re-sizing will cover more of the trade-offs
that can be made when getting a picture ready to print or put on the
Internet. </p>
<h3 class="western">Channels</h3>
<p>In a photograph, one pixel can represent many different colors. To
express this in a computer, pixels are represented with different
"channels" for the different colors. A typical image will have
three channels: Red, Green, and Blue, for images without color, they
will have a single channel (different shades of grey). Each channel
states how strong that color is, for example a pixel that has very
strong red channel and very weak green and blue channels would show
up as red. A pixel where all three channels are very strong would be
close to white, and where they are all weak, close to black. <br>
</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="RasterGraphics/200px-AdditiveColor.svg.png" alt="200px-AdditiveColor.svg.png"></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The following image is an example of pixels and color channels.
The original image is the tiny face in the upper left corner. In the
second, enlarged version of the face, you can see the individual
pixels of the image, arranged in rows and columns, that make up the
image. Then in the bottom, even more enlarged segment, you can see
three pixels that make up a small area in the bottom-left corner of
the image. This segment has the values for the Red, Green, and Blue
channels written over the top of each pixel.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="RasterGraphics/Rgb-raster-en.png" alt="Rgb-raster-en.png"></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In this case we can see that to make a medium-grey color we turn
the Red channel up to 80% of its full intensity, the Green channel
also up to 80%, and the Blue channel to 77%. Notice that all three
of these are above 50%, so in all the channel is fairly
bright....this grey color is a lot closer to white than it is to
black. Next, to get a dingy brown, we would put the red and green
channels to 36% and the blue channel only to 13%. Because all these
are significantly less than 50%, the overall color is dark and
getting closer to black. Finally, to get a yellow, we turn the red
and green channels almost all the way up (if we wanted a "true"
yellow we would turn them all the way up) and leave the blue set at
zero. </p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Try out for yourself adjusting the amounts of Red Green and Blue
in each channel and see what colors you can come up with.</p>
<p><a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/slider/slider-rgb_clean.html">http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/slider/slider-rgb_clean.html</a></p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Some raster formats also have a channel called "Alpha" that
specifies how bright the pixel is. If the alpha channel is low, then
it would be possible for an image that is stacked behind the one
being show to show through. This is called transparency. If there
is nothing behind the image, then the default is usually black. </p>
<h3 class="western">File Types</h3>
<b>Photo Size</b>
<p>For a typical photograph, each of the three (Red, Green, and Blue)
channels are represented by one byte of data for each pixel. This
means that it requires three bytes of data for each pixel, this is
often referred to as 24 bit color (24 bits, because 8 bits equals 1
byte and there are three bytes). Because each byte can hold 2^8 or
256 different values, each channel can have 256 different levels of
that color (1/256 or 0.39% change per level if everything is done
evenly). You may have noticed that the R G and B values on the
demonstration we used in the channels section only had 256 different
options, if you don't remember, go back and check it out now:</p>
<p><a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/slider/slider-rgb_clean.html">http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/slider/slider-rgb_clean.html</a></p>
<p>Because there are three different channels, that means each pixel
can represent 256x256x256 colors or over 16 million different color
combinations. That's a lot more than even the largest box of
crayons. </p>
<p>For an 12 megapixel image from a modern camera, this means that it
would require 36 Megabytes (MB) of storage space! That's a lot when
you go out with your camera and want to take a bunch of pictures. If
you have a 1 Gigabyte (GB) memory card for your camera, that would
only allow you to store about 30 images. </p>
<p>Because of the huge size of files that just contain the pixels,
people have come up with various ways of compressing images into
smaller files. These can be put into two different groups: Lossless
and Lossy. </p>
<p><b>Lossless Compression </b>
</p>
<p>Lossless compression takes the files and finds ways to
mathematically make them smaller, in a way that can be completely
un-done. The easiest way to do this is to run the image through a
general compression tool like zip. Zip is a tool that is available
on all computers, that goes through any file (not just images) and
finds ways to make it smaller. One simple way this is done is if
there are many pixels in an area that are the same color, there can
be an instruction that when the image is drawn to color that whole
area in the correct color. That instruction telling what the
computer to do can be hundreds of times smaller than the amount of
space it would require to store all the pixels in the area. There
are many other ways to do this, but they are generally very
complicated and beyond the scope of this material.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossless_data_compression">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossless_data_compression</a></p>
<p><b>Lossy Compression </b>
</p>
<p>Lossy compression is different in that once a file is compressed
there is no way to get back the exact same file, some detail is
always lost. Since images are made of millions of pixels each
possible of representing millions of different colors, there is some
room for removing detail before the human eye would notice any
difference. This can be done with a combination of the lossless
compression methods, as well as things like assuming that a color of
one pixel is similar to the pixels surrounding it, and many more
complicated methods. Also beyond the scope of this material. </p>
<p>Below are three examples which illustrate lossy compression. The
example on the left is the original and was compressed with loss-less
compression. The middle picture was compressed with lossy
compression, which was set to not loose very much data. The image on
the right used lossy compression with very aggressive settings. It
made a much smaller file size than the middle one (1.1KB vs 9.4 KB)
but obviously the compression removed parts of the image that are
important for making it look good.&nbsp; <br>

<p><b>File Storage</b></p>
<p>There are many different types of files that are used for images,
most of which support one or more specific lossless or lossy
compression methods. Below is an overview of them, there are many
less-used formats in addition that aren't listed here. See:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_file_formats">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_file_formats</a>

for more information.</p>
<p><b>Bitmap</b> (.bmp, others) -- Contains all the pixels of the
image, without compression. The .bmp format specifically is used by
Microsoft in their programs for displaying images, but similar
methods are used in all types of computers. As it stores all the
pixels, this is a lossless format, in fact by default it is not
compressed at all.</p>
<p><b>JPEG</b> (.jpg, .jpeg) -- Stands for Joint Photographic
Experts Group, was developed specifically for storing images taken by
digital cameras, and is by far the most used format for digital
photographs. This is a lossy format, however with typical settings
it is very difficult to detect and image degradation.</p>
<p><b>PNG</b> (.png) -- Portable Network Graphics is better at
storing images that don't have a lot of detail, such as graphics on
websites. This is a lossless format. </p>
<p><b>GIF</b> (.gif) -- Graphics Interchange Format is similar to
but older than PNG. In general PNG should be used instead, however
there is one feature that it has that PNG currently does not, which
is to be able to have multiple images stored inside it, which can be
played back as a simple animation. </p>
<p><b>JPEG2000</b> (.jp2) -- This was an attempt at creating a
better version of the JPEG format, however it has not been very
successful, and is mostly used in professional situations such as
medical imaging. This format has options that can make it lossless
or lossy. </p>
<p><b>JPEG XR/HD Photo</b> (.jxr) -- This is another attempt at
creating a better version of the JPEG format, originally developed by
Microsoft as "HD Photo" it was submitted to the Joint
Photographic Experts Group who accepted it as a new standard. It has
not yet caught on in mainstream use. This format has options that
can make it lossless or lossy. </p>
<p><b>WebP</b> (.webp) -- This is a new format developed by Google
that is designed for replacing JPEG (and some PNG) for use in images
on the web. It is not currently supported by all web browsers, but
work is ongoing on it. This format is lossy. </p>
<p><b>TIFF</b> (.tif, .tiff) -- Tagged Image File Format is used
mostly for images of documents (such as scans). It has support for
multiple pages of images, as well as metadata such as where the image
was collected, who wrote it, etc. Usually it is used as a lossless
format, but it has the ability to use JPEG or other types of
compression inside it. </p>
<p><b>Raw</b> (.raw, .cr2, .crw, .nef, .nrw, dng, and more) -- Raw
images are not a specific format, but a grouping of many different
formats, all of which are built from cameras. By default cameras
usually produce JPEG images, which are lossy and don't contain all
the basic data that the camera recorded about the image. When a
photographer gets a raw image, he or she gets all the data that the
camera collected, which can be useful when doing advanced processing
of the images on a computer. </p>
<p><b>XCF</b> (.xcf) -- eXperimental Computing Facility is the name
of the file format used to store projects in the Gimp photo editor. It
stores photographs losslessly, and can store multiple layers of
photos and other data such as text, lines, selections and more.</p>
<p><b>PSD</b> (.psd) -- PhotoShop Document very similar to the XCF
format, but used by photoshop. It is also lossless, and can store
multiple layers of photographs and data. </p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Bonus, non raster-image formats:</p>
<p><b>EXIF</b> - Exchangeable Image File Format is used for metadata
about the image, it is not a file on its own, but is encorporated
into other files such as JPEG. It can contain a huge number of
different data fields including: date the image was taken, camera
settings, exposure time, apature size, zoom level, GPS coordinates of
the camera, direction the camera was facing, and many more. </p>
<p><b>SVG</b> (.svg) -- Scalable Vector Graphics files are used to
store images generated on a computer, not photographs. These files
do not store any pixels, but rather store information about where
lines, circles, text, and other components are in relationship to
each other (referred to with vectors). It is called scalable because
the instructions for creating the image can be given any unit of
length and make the entire image based on that. In addition the
instructions for generating the image can include references to
amounts of time, so the image can change as it is drawn making an
animation. Because there are no pixels to be calculated, this is an
inherently lossless format. </p>
<p><b>EPS</b> (.eps) -- Encapsulated Post Script files as similar to
SVG files, but somewhat older and has more limited features, such as
not being able to do animation. </p>

<p><b>Paint.NET</b> -- Similar, but less powerful than Gimp and

</p>
<p><b>Corel Paint Shop Photo Pro</b> -- Almost as powerful as Gimp
and Photoshop, but a substantially different interface from them. -

<p><b>Microsoft Paint</b> -- Comes built in with windows, but is
very basic. Even things like cropping and re-sizing are very
difficult. It is usable if you want to add a little text to an
image, or draw over something so that others can't see it (like
blanking out a screen name or IP address in a screenshot), but not
much beyond that.</p>
<p><b>Microsoft Photo Editor </b>or <b>Photo Manager </b>-- Tools
from Microsoft that come with Microsoft Office. Useful for basic
editing, such as cropping and re-sizing. </p>
<p><b>ImageMagick</b> -- A command line based tool (there are also
various graphical user interfaces for it) that instead of editing an
image by click on it edits the image by specifying commands that can
be done to it (e.g. -resize 30%, -crop 120x120, convert image.jpg
image.png and lots more). This is really great if you have a lot of
images and want to do the same thing to all of them. For instance
you can easily resize hundreds of images in a few seconds instead of
opening them up in the Gimp and resizing them one by one. Image magic
is free, libre, and open source software and runs on Linux, Windows,
and Mac. - <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/">http://www.imagemagick.org/</a>

<h1 class="western">Unit Two -- Graphics</h1>
<h2 class="western">Vector Graphics</h2>
<p>Unlike raster images (photos, covered in Unit One) vector graphics
do not consist of pixels arranged on a grid with different values.
Instead vector graphics are stored as sets of instructions that a
computer can run to re-create a graphic. </p>
<p>A simplistic example of these instructions could be:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Create a circle with a center 3 units above the center, and a
radius of 2 units. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fill circle with yellow</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Create a line from 2 units below the center to 3 units above and
two units left of the center.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Create a line from 2 units below the center to 3 units above and
two units right of the center.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>If there were a program that could run this very simple script, it
might draw to the screen the following:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="VectorGraphics/SimpleScriptOutput.png" alt="SimpleScriptOutput.png"></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The good thing about this is that you'll most likely never have to
actually look at the script the computer creates, just like you never
have to look at the array of pixels and channels that are stored in a
photograph. However, if you want to get advanced, that would be
possible (and quite a bit easier than editing a raster image). Instead,
we will be using tools that convert the things we draw with
the mouse and keyboard into one of these scripts that the computer
can follow when it wants to re-produce an image to view on the screen
(the screen is really just a raster graphic viewer). Then when we
are all done, we can have it run the script again to produce another
raster graphic that can be saved into a PNG file. </p>
<p>It is also possible for this script to include a certain amount of
time to wait before something happens. This allows for animations
some simple examples would be having a stick figure move across the
image or having a ball bounce.</p>
<h3 class="western">File Formats</h3>
<p>The primary file format currently in use is SVG or Scalable Vector
Graphics (see: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svg">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svg</a>
) which is a type of human readable file called XML. Although XML
and SVG are human-readable, we will not be reading them directly as
part of this material. SVG is supported in most vector drawing
programs, however it is not yet supported by all web browsers (though
this is rapidly changing). If you simply want to use your images on
web pages, it is best to convert them to Portable Network Graphics
(PNG) which is a lossless raster format. </p>
<p>The other major format for Vector Graphics is the EPS or
Encapsulated Post Script. Post Script itself is a file type used for
printing (especially industrial printing), and EPS images are built
to be easily put inside of a Post Script document. This format has
been around a lot longer than SVG, and is supported by many more
tools (especially the old ones). Likewise, it is not recommended for
use with web browsers. </p>
