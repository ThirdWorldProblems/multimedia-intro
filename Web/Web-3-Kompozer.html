<h2>Kompozer</h2>
There are many editors out there, that will assist in writing the HTML
code for a web page.&nbsp; However they usually force the user to work
with the actual code.&nbsp; Instead of that, we will be using an editor
called Kompozer, which allows you to edit web pages in much the same
way as you would edit a Microsoft Word document. This type of editor is
called a What You See Is What You Get (or WYSIWYG, pronounced
whi-see-wig) editor.&nbsp; This type of editor probably won't be very
useful to a profesional web-site creator, but it is great for starting
out because it allows you to seamlessly bounce back and forth between
the code for the page and a view of the page that you can see what it
looks like (and edit it). Once you get the basics down, then you can
move on to more advanced design tools.<br>
