<h2>Kompozer</h2>

There are many editors out there, that will assist in writing the HTML
code for a web page.&nbsp; However they usually force the user to work
with the actual code.&nbsp; Instead of that, we will be using an editor
called Kompozer, which allows you to edit web pages in much the same
way as you would edit a Microsoft Word document. This type of editor is
called a What You See Is What You Get (or WYSIWYG, pronounced
whi-see-wig) editor.&nbsp; This type of editor probably won't be very
useful to a profesional web-site creator, but it is great for starting
out because it allows you to seamlessly bounce back and forth between
the code for the page and a view of the page that you can see what it
looks like (and edit it). Once you get the basics down, then you can
move on to more advanced design tools.
<h3>Writing text, formatting</h3>

Writing text for your page works in a manner that is very similar
to
Microsoft Word or Open Office Write.&nbsp; You type text in the main
window, and then use the buttons in the toolbar to format it.<br>

[picture outlining the formatting toolbars]<br>

<br>

There are two lines of tools for formatting, located below the main
tool bar and above the document.&nbsp; The first line has the following
tools, from left to right:<br>

Text format - This allows you to specify that text is a section header,
part of the body of the text, or a few other options.&nbsp; <br>

Empty Bar - Ignore the next drop down. <br>

Empahsize - Will add <em>emphasis</em> to text (basically the same as
italics).<br>

Strong Empahsize - Will add <strong>strong emphasis</strong> to text
(basically the same as bold).<br>

Numbered List - Creates a lits where items are sequential in order.<br>

Bulleted List - Creates a list where items aren't in a particular
order, so have bullets in front of them.<br>

Increase Indent - Moves the section of text further to the right.<br>

Decrease Indent - Moves the section of text further to the left.<br>

<br>

On the second line are the following tools:<br>

Font - Pick the font you want to use. Be careful with this, as web
pages need to be viewed from all computers and not all computers have
the same fonts installed.&nbsp; <br>

Text/Background Color - Pick the color of the text and/or background.<br>

Highlighter - Highlight text<br>

Decrease Text Size - Make text smaller.<br>

Increase Text Size - Make text larger.<br>

Bold - Make text bold.<br>

Italics - Put text in italics<br>

Underline - Put a line under the text.<br>

Left Justify - Make the left side of the text lineup<br>

Center - Make each line of text centered<br>

Right Justify - Make the right side of the text lineup<br>

Align Justified - Stretch the text so that both the left and right
sides lineup<br>
<h3>
Links</h3>

Links are the key to any web page. To make a link, select the text that
you want to be the link.&nbsp; Then click the Link button from the main
toolbar.&nbsp; Now you can enter the address of the web page you want
the link to go to. This can be a full URL (called "absolute") like
http://google.com/MyPage.html or it can be a local URL (called
relative) like MyFolder/MyPage.html.&nbsp; Then click OK.&nbsp; That's
all there is to it!<br>
<h3>
Images</h3>
Putting an image in a page with Kompozer is similar to a link.&nbsp;
Click the spot where you want the link to go, then click the image
button from the main toolbar.&nbsp; Here you enter the URL for the
image. In addition, every time you put in an image, you should enter
the alternate text for the image. This allows people to read what the
image is about before it loads and allows people who can't see the web
page to still understand what is on the page.<br>
