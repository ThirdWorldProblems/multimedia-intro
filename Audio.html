<h3 class="western">Formats</h3><p>CD Audio - The most common format you will find is CD audio, it is uncompressed audio.&nbsp; This format is 16-bit, Linear Pulse Code Modulation (L-PCM), signed data, running at a 44.1kHz sampling rate, with two channels of audio (stereo).&nbsp; It runs at 146KB/s.&nbsp; <br></p>WAV - Unlike CD Audio, that specifies exact paramaters, WAV files are capable of contaning many different formats, however the most common one that it contains is identical to the CD audio format: 16-bit, L-PCM, signed, 44.1kHz.&nbsp; WAV files are almost always found with uncompressed data, however it is possible to use compression inside them.<br><br>Other uncompressed formats - You will often find formats that simply specify a type (PCM, mu-Law, A-Law), a size (8-bit, 16-bit, 24-bit, etc), signed or unsigned, a frequency (32, 44.1, 48), endianess (big or little), number of channels, and bit-rate.&nbsp; <br><p></p><p>MP2 - Stands for MPEG-1 audio, layer 2.&nbsp; Often used in broadcasting.<br></p>
<p>MP3 - Stands for MPEG-1 audio, layer 3.&nbsp; This is the most popular audio format, as is evidinced by the number of MP3 players available at electronics stores.&nbsp; Almost all computers and consumer audio players can play this format.&nbsp; <br></p>
<p>AC3 - This is also known as Dolby Digital sound, made popular by its use in movie theaters.&nbsp; It is used on many DVDs and supports 5.1 channel sound.&nbsp; <br></p>
<p>FLAC - Free Lossless Audio Codec.&nbsp; This audio format was made to take uncompressed formats and shrink them down, without losing any quality at all.&nbsp; Audio in this format can be converted back to an uncompressed format, and the resulting file would be identical to the original uncompressed file.&nbsp; This is often used for editing and archival, where you want to be sure not to lose any information.&nbsp; Files are usually about half the size of an uncompressed file.&nbsp; This format is open source, and free of royalties, so it can be used anywhere.<br></p>
<p>Ogg/Vorbis - This is the leanding open source compressed audio format.&nbsp; Its compression is aproximately twice as good as MP3, and on par with AAC or WMA compression.&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<p>AAC - Advanced Audio Codec&nbsp; This is Apple's primary audio codec. It is available on Macintosh, in iTunes, and on iPods/iPhones.&nbsp; <br></p><p>WMA - Windows Media Audio.&nbsp; This is microsoft's primary audio codec.&nbsp; It is available on Windows computers and many portable devices.<br></p>Speex - This is a codec that was developed specifically for compressing human voices.&nbsp; It is not a high fidelity codec, and should not be used with music or sound effects, but is good at accurately re-producing the human voice.<br><h2>Ripping a CD</h2>Get audio into WAV format.<br>Convert to FLAC.<br>Convert to Ogg-Vorbis and MP3.<br><h2>Audacity</h2>Channels<br><br>Cutting <br><br>Filtering<br><br><h2>Podcast</h2>RSS Feed with enclosure.&nbsp; <br><h2>Live Streaming</h2>Icecast/Shoutcast<br><br><h2>Other</h2>Ardor - A professional Digital Audio Workstation.&nbsp; It is a non-linear editor, with a ton of important features.&nbsp; Available as free software. <a href="http://ardour.org/">http://ardour.org/</a>&nbsp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardour_%28software%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardour_(software)</a><br><br>Podcast Generator - Program that runs on a server and manages your podcast feed for you.&nbsp; <a href="http://podcastgen.sourceforge.net/">http://podcastgen.sourceforge.net/</a><br><br><br> <br><br>
