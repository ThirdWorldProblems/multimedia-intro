<h3>Recording and Playback - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Activity</span><br>
</h3>

Write your answer to the following questions:<br>

1) Where were you born?<br>

<br>

2) What are the names of your parents?<br>

<br>

3) What is your favorite movie?<br>

<br>

4) What is your favorite song?&nbsp; Who wrote it?<br>

<br>

5) What time did you get out of bed this morning?<br>

<br>

6) What did you eat at your most recent meal?<br>

<br>

7) What do you do in your free time?<br>

<br>

Now use a microphone and audacity to record your answers to these
questions (you don't need to record the questions, just the answers you
have written out).&nbsp; <br>

Listen to your answers and make sure that they are all clear and easy
to understand.<br>

Save the project and export the audio out to a .FLAC file.&nbsp; <br>

<br>

<h3>Cutting - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Activity</span><br>
</h3>

Create a new project, import the recording of your responses to the
questions in the previous activity (the .FLAC file).&nbsp; Then import
this recording of the questions. &nbsp; Cut and move the sections of
audio around so that each question is followed by the appropriate
response.<br>

Save the project and expor the audio out to a .FLAC file.&nbsp; <br>

<br>

<h3>Channels - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Activity</span><br>
</h3>

Follow the same steps as the previous activity (import your responses
from the recording activity, and this recording of the
questions).&nbsp; Once again, cut and move the sections so that each
question is followed by the appropriate response, however, this time,
keep them in seperate channels.&nbsp; Once everything is in order, set
the seperate channels to left and right audio, so that the person
asking and the person answering sound like they are in different
directions.<br>

<br>

<h3>Filters and Effects - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Activity</span><br>
</h3>

For this activity, make a recording of yourself asking the questions
(the same questions from the recording activity).&nbsp; Now that you
have a recording of yourself asking and answering the questions,
combine them into the correct order, as was done in the channels
activity.&nbsp; To differientate the person asking from the person
answering, apply filters such as [ADD FILTERS HERE] to each of the
channels to give them their own unique, but still natural sound.&nbsp; <br>
