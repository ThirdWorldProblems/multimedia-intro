<h3 class="western">Formats</h3><p>CD Audio - The most common format you will find is CD audio, it is uncompressed audio.&nbsp; This format is 16-bit, Linear Pulse Code Modulation (L-PCM), signed data, running at a 44.1kHz sampling rate, with two channels of audio (stereo).&nbsp; It runs at 146KB/s.&nbsp; <br></p>WAV - Unlike CD Audio, that specifies exact paramaters, WAV files are capable of contaning many different formats, however the most common one that it contains is identical to the CD audio format: 16-bit, L-PCM, signed, 44.1kHz.&nbsp; WAV files are almost always found with uncompressed data, however it is possible to use compression inside them.<br><br>Other uncompressed formats - You will often find formats that simply specify a type (PCM, mu-Law, A-Law), a size (8-bit, 16-bit, 24-bit, etc), signed or unsigned, a frequency (32, 44.1, 48), endianess (big or little), number of channels, and bit-rate.&nbsp; <br><p></p><p>MP2 - Stands for MPEG-1 audio, layer 2.&nbsp; Often used in broadcasting.<br></p>
<p>MP3 - Stands for MPEG-1 audio, layer 3<br></p>
