<p style="font-weight: bold;">Sound<br></p><p>Sound moving through the air is composed of small changes in air pressure that move rapidly (at the speed of sound, 1,230 km/h at sea level) out from the source.&nbsp; In our ears there is a small membrane and a set of bones that is succeptible to these tiny (and very rapid) changes in pressure.&nbsp; Here is a graph of what the pressure recorded near by a set of hands clapping one time looks like (this was recorded by a microphone over 5/100ths of a second.&nbsp; Listen to the <a href="Audio/Clap.flac">audio file</a>, save to your computer and open in VLC or Audacity):<br><img style="width: 863px; height: 354px;" src="AudioScreen/Clap.png" alt="Clap.png"><br>As you can see, a sound that we think of as one instantaneous event, is actually composed of several different changes in pressure.&nbsp; Spikes above the middle of the graph indicate higher pressure, and below the graph indicate lower pressure.&nbsp; Because sound generally doesn't move any air, it simply compresses/decompresses it to higher/lower pressure for a split second at a time, the pressure changes above and below the curve must balance out.&nbsp; In general, process when each time the pressure goes up above the curve, comes back down to the curve, continues below the curve and then comes back up to the curve, is called a cycle.&nbsp; The number of cycles per second that the sound does this is is called the rate, the unit for which is Hertz, abbreviated Hz.&nbsp; So if a particular sound is at 500 cycles per second, we call that 500Hz.&nbsp; We can also use the standard metric pre-fixes for it.&nbsp; A sound at 31,000 Hz could be written as 31kHz.&nbsp; Just for a reference, the human ear can detect sounds from approximately 20Hz up to 20kHz.&nbsp; <br></p>The way we hear the frequency is as different tones.&nbsp; It is possible that we will have a tone with only a single frequency.&nbsp; An example of that is below (2kHz, 0.01 seconds):<br><img src="AudioScreen/2kHz.png" alt="2kHz.png"><br>As you can see, it takes exactly 1/2000th of a second for the wave to go from the center up, all the way down, and back to the center.&nbsp; Here is a <a href="Audio/2kHzTone.flac">longer example</a> of the same sound to listen to (save it and open it in VLC or Audacity).&nbsp; You can see that this pure tone sample is a lot different than the clap example above.&nbsp; This is because, most sounds that we hear aren't exactly one frequency, but rather a mixed-up jumble of frequencies that we hear all together.&nbsp; What happens is we'll hear thousands of different frequencies each second, each for a very short amount of time.&nbsp; The way this happens, it that the waves of the frequencies will either work together to make that particular part stronger, or go against each other to make a part weaker. <br>Below is two sounds, 2.333kHz on top and 2.000kHz in the middle, which, when added together, make the sound on the bottom:<br><img src="AudioScreen/DualToneExample.png" alt="DualToneExample.png"><br><p>You can see in this image, that where the high and low parts of the wave are together and line up, the wave's get bigger.&nbsp; Where they don't line up, they cancel each other out, and become smaller.&nbsp; This <a href="Audio/DualToneDemo.flac">audio file</a> will play all three tones, first 2.333kHz, then 2.000kHz, then the combination of both.&nbsp; By combining the correct sets of frequencies, for the correct duration, you can make any sound imaginable.<br></p><p>As we saw before, when we combine different frequencies, it changes the height of the waves, this hieght (both positive and negative) is called the amplitude, and represents how loud the sound is.&nbsp; The higher the waves go, the louder the sounnd you will hear.&nbsp; This scale is generally measured in decibles (dB).&nbsp; They range from zero (0dB) being the quietest sound perceptable to the human ear (at 1kHz), to 194dB being the loudest sound that the earth's atmophere can carry.&nbsp; Some examples in between: calm breathing 10dB, a normal conversation 40-60dB, TV at a normal level 60dB, a busy roadway 80dB, a jack hammer 100dB, a jet engine 130dB, and a rifle being shot 160db.&nbsp; <br></p><p>What Sample Frequency</p><p>Pulse Code Modulation - Wave Properties</p><p>bits per sample</p>

<h3 class="western">Formats</h3><p>CD Audio - The most common format you will find is CD audio, it is uncompressed audio.&nbsp; This format is 16-bit, Linear Pulse Code Modulation (L-PCM), signed data, running at a 44.1kHz sampling rate, with two channels of audio (stereo).&nbsp; It runs at 146KB/s.&nbsp; <br></p>WAV - Unlike CD Audio, that specifies exact paramaters, WAV files are capable of contaning many different formats, however the most common one that it contains is identical to the CD audio format: 16-bit, L-PCM, signed, 44.1kHz.&nbsp; WAV files are almost always found with uncompressed data, however it is possible to use compression inside them.<br><br>Other uncompressed formats - You will often find formats that simply specify a type (PCM, mu-Law, A-Law), a size (8-bit, 16-bit, 24-bit, etc), signed or unsigned, a frequency (32, 44.1, 48), endianess (big or little), number of channels, and bit-rate.&nbsp; <br><p></p><p>MP2 - Stands for MPEG-1 audio, layer 2.&nbsp; Often used in broadcasting.<br></p>
<p>MP3 - Stands for MPEG-1 audio, layer 3.&nbsp; This is the most popular audio format, as is evidinced by the number of MP3 players available at electronics stores.&nbsp; Almost all computers and consumer audio players can play this format.&nbsp; <br></p>
<p>AC3 - This is also known as Dolby Digital sound, made popular by its use in movie theaters.&nbsp; It is used on many DVDs and supports 5.1 channel sound.&nbsp; <br></p>
<p>FLAC - Free Lossless Audio Codec.&nbsp; This audio format was made to take uncompressed formats and shrink them down, without losing any quality at all.&nbsp; Audio in this format can be converted back to an uncompressed format, and the resulting file would be identical to the original uncompressed file.&nbsp; This is often used for editing and archival, where you want to be sure not to lose any information.&nbsp; Files are usually about half the size of an uncompressed file.&nbsp; This format is open source, and free of royalties, so it can be used anywhere.<br></p>
<p>Ogg/Vorbis - This is the leanding open source compressed audio format.&nbsp; Its compression is aproximately twice as good as MP3, and on par with AAC or WMA compression.&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<p>AAC - Advanced Audio Codec&nbsp; This is Apple's primary audio codec. It is available on Macintosh, in iTunes, and on iPods/iPhones.&nbsp; <br></p><p>WMA - Windows Media Audio.&nbsp; This is microsoft's primary audio codec.&nbsp; It is available on Windows computers and many portable devices.<br></p>Speex - This is a codec that was developed specifically for compressing human voices.&nbsp; It is not a high fidelity codec, and should not be used with music or sound effects, but is good at accurately re-producing the human voice.<br><h2>Ripping a CD</h2>Get audio into WAV format.<br>Convert to FLAC.<br>Convert to Ogg-Vorbis and MP3.<br><h2>Audacity</h2>Channels<br><br>Cutting <br><br>Filtering<br><br><h2>Podcast</h2>RSS Feed with enclosure.&nbsp; <br><h2>Live Streaming</h2>Icecast/Shoutcast<br><br><h2>Other</h2>Ardor - A professional Digital Audio Workstation.&nbsp; It is a non-linear editor, with a ton of important features.&nbsp; Available as free software. <a href="http://ardour.org/">http://ardour.org/</a>&nbsp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardour_%28software%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardour_(software)</a><br><br>Podcast Generator - Program that runs on a server and manages your podcast feed for you.&nbsp; <a href="http://podcastgen.sourceforge.net/">http://podcastgen.sourceforge.net/</a><br><br><br> Attribution<br>Signal Sampling, Binksternet, <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Signal_Sampling.png">http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Signal_Sampling.png</a>, Public Domain<br><br>
