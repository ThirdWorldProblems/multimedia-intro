<h2 class="western">Photos</h2>

<p>Photo files are stored in what is called a "raster" format. This
means that the image is composed of a grid of points (in rows
and columns). These points are called pixels, and they contain the
color for that point. The number of rows and columns that make up
the grid are called the dimensions. A picture that has 33 Columns
(width) and 22 Rows (height) has dimensions of 33x22, and has a total
of 726 pixels. In general the dimensions of digital images are
always written in the form of "width x height".</p>

<p>Modern digital cameras have much, much higher dimensions. They
are often referred based on how many <b>millions</b><span style="font-weight: normal;">
of pixels or "megapixels" they have.&nbsp; Photos with more pixels are
said
to have a higher "Resolution" while pictures with less pixels in them
have a smaller resolution. &nbsp; Some examples of photo dimensions and
their number of pixels and megapixels are:</span></p>

<p style="font-weight: normal;">640x480 = 307200 pixels = 0.3
megapixels<br>
1024x768 = 786432 pixels = 0.8 megapixels<br>
1280x960 =
1228800 pixels = 1.2 megapixels <br>
1600x1200 = 1920000 pixels = 1.9
megapixels<br>
2842x2136 = 6070512 pixels = 6 megapixels<br>
4000x3000
= 12000000 pixels = 12 megapixels</p>

<p style="font-weight: normal;">Looking at all these, they have
something in common, if the first number is divided by the second
number, they all approximately equal 1.33. The lowest ratio that
equals 1.33 is 4/3, so this format of images is said to have a 4:3
ratio. </p>

<img src="RasterGraphics/FourThirdsFormula.png" alt="FourThirdsFormula.png"><br>

<p style="font-weight: normal;">This is usually the standard for
photography, when the camera is held normally - this is also known as a
"landscape" orientation. When the camera is held rotated to the side,
this ratio changes to 3:4 and is called "portrait" orientation.&nbsp;
Other resolutions will be looked at more in the video
unit. </p>

<p>The reason that cameras have grown the number of megapixels they
use, is because that (with everything else being equal) larger
dimensions make the image look better, especially when you print it
out. A good printer can print photographs at 4800 dots per inch or
dpi. In this case "inches" (1in = 2.45cm) and "dots" (equal
to a pixel) are used because of their history in the printing
industry. </p>

<p>This means that a 12 megapixel image (4000x3000) could be printed
out to a 2.1x1.6cm image and every pixel would be visible. </p>

<img src="RasterGraphics/WidthDPIFormula.png" alt="WidthDPIFormula.png"><img src="RasterGraphics/HeightDPIFormula.png" alt="HeightDPIFormula.png"><br>

<p>However, if it were printed to a 4.2x3.2cm image, then every pixel
would be represented by four dots on the paper. If the sizes were
doubled again to 8.4x6.4cm then every pixel would be represented by
16 dots on the paper. This starts to become a problem when you have
an image without that many pixels in it and want to print (or display
it on a screen) as a large image. At some point, the individual
pixels become easily visible on the printed image, and that can give
it a very blocky and unnatural feeling. </p>

<p>The pictures below are both the same piece of an large image taken
of a tortoise. The photo on the top is from the full size 12
megapixel (4000x3000) image. The photo on the bottom was taken at a
much lower dimension of 640x480. Notice how the pixels of the image
are clearly visible in the lower image and it doesn't look clear.</p>

<p>As a rule of thumb, it is important to keep the best possible
image (most pixels), at least while working with it to edit. The
section on cropping and re-sizing will cover more of the trade-offs
that can be made when getting a picture ready to print or put on the
Internet. </p>

<h3 class="western">Channels</h3>

<p>In a photograph, one pixel can represent many different colors. To
express this in a computer, pixels are represented with different
"channels" for the different colors. A typical image will have
three channels: Red, Green, and Blue, for images without color, they
will have a single channel (different shades of gray). Each channel
states how strong that color is, for example a pixel that has very
strong red channel and very weak green and blue channels would show
up as red. A pixel where all three channels are very strong would be
close to white, and where they are all weak, close to black. <br>
</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The following image is an example of pixels and color channels.
The original image is the tiny face in the upper left corner. In the
second, enlarged version of the face, you can see the individual
pixels of the image, arranged in rows and columns, that make up the
image. Then in the bottom, even more enlarged segment, you can see
three pixels that make up a small area in the bottom-left corner of
the image. This segment has the values for the Red, Green, and Blue
channels written over the top of each pixel.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>In this case we can see that to make a medium-gray color we turn
the Red channel up to 80% of its full intensity, the Green channel
also up to 80%, and the Blue channel to 77%. Notice that all three
of these are above 50%, so in all the channel is fairly
bright....this gray color is a lot closer to white than it is to
black. Next, to get a dingy brown, we would put the red and green
channels to 36% and the blue channel only to 13%. Because all these
are significantly less than 50%, the overall color is dark and
getting closer to black. Finally, to get a yellow, we turn the red
and green channels almost all the way up (if we wanted a "true"
yellow we would turn them all the way up) and leave the blue set at
zero. </p>

<p>Try it out for yourself by adjusting the sliders for the amounts of
Red Green and Blue
in each channel and see what colors you can come up with.<br>

<p>Some raster formats also have a channel called "Alpha" that
specifies how bright the pixel is. If the alpha channel is low, then
it would be possible for an image that is stacked behind the one
being show to show through. This is called transparency. If there
is nothing behind the image, then the default is usually black. <br>
