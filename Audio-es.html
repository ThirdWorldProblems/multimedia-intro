<h3>Recording and Playback - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Activity</span><br>
</h3>

Write your answer to the following questions:<br>

1) Where were you born?<br>

<br>

2) What are the names of your parents?<br>

<br>

3) What is your favorite movie?<br>

<br>

4) What is your favorite song?&nbsp; Who wrote it?<br>

<br>

5) What time did you get out of bed this morning?<br>

<br>

6) What did you eat at your most recent meal?<br>

<br>

7) What do you do in your free time?<br>

<br>

Now use a microphone and audacity to record your answers to these
questions (you don't need to record the questions, just the answers you
have written out).&nbsp; <br>

Listen to your answers and make sure that they are all clear and easy
to understand.<br>

Save the project and export the audio out to a .FLAC file.&nbsp; <br>

<br>

<h3>Cutting - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Activity</span><br>
</h3>

Create a new project, import the recording of your responses to the
questions in the previous activity (the .FLAC file).&nbsp; Then import
this recording of the questions. &nbsp; Cut and move the sections of
audio around so that each question is followed by the appropriate
response.<br>

Save the project and export the audio out to a .FLAC file.&nbsp; <br>

<br>

<h3>Channels - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Activity</span><br>
</h3>

Follow the same steps as the previous activity (import your responses
from the recording activity, and this recording of the
questions).&nbsp; Once again, cut and move the sections so that each
question is followed by the appropriate response, however, this time,
keep them in seperate channels.&nbsp; Once everything is in order, set
the separate channels to left and right audio, so that the person
asking and the person answering sound like they are in different
directions.<br>

<br>

<h3>Filters and Effects - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Activity</span><br>
</h3>

For this activity, make a recording of yourself asking the questions
(the same questions from the recording activity).&nbsp; Now that you
have a recording of yourself asking and answering the questions,
combine them into the correct order, as was done in the channels
activity.&nbsp; To differentiate the person asking from the person
answering, apply filters such as [ADD FILTERS HERE] to each of the
channels to give them their own unique, but still natural sound.&nbsp; <br>

<h3>Podcast Creator - Activity</h3>

For this activity we're going to create our own podcast.&nbsp; We're
going to start by creating two sepearte audio recordings, episode one
and episode two.&nbsp; Then, using the example of RSS with enclosures,
we're going to create our own feed.&nbsp; Because it won't be hosted on
a web-site but simply in a folder on the computer, don't put http:// in
front of the path, but instead file://.&nbsp; (Give the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><a href="podcast/local_podcast.rss">example</a>?)<br>

<h2>Other</h2>
Ardor - A professional Digital Audio Workstation.&nbsp; It is a
non-linear editor (like audacity), with a ton of important
features.&nbsp; It specialized in working with many tracks at once,
such as trying to master a CD of a band's recording. Available as
free software. <a href="http://ardour.org/">http://ardour.org/</a>&nbsp;
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardour_%28software%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardour_(software)</a><br>

<br>
JACK - Connector and flow for audio recording.&nbsp; This allows you to
take audio from any program in your computer and send it to another
program.&nbsp; There are ancilary applications that allow it to be
mixed, equalized, etc. <br>

<br>
Adobe Soundbooth and Adobe Adition - Adobe makes two seperate audioe
editing applications.&nbsp; The level of complexity of these falls
somewhere between Audacity and Ardor.&nbsp; For a comparison of these
two see: <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/soundbooth/compare/">http://www.adobe.com/products/soundbooth/compare/</a>.<br>

<br>
Apple Garage Band - This is Apple's audio editing software.&nbsp; It
was made for musical recordings, but people have had success using it
for voice recordings also.<br>
<h2>
Vocab</h2>

Sound - Rapid changes in air pressure that can be detected by the human
ear. <br>

Waveform - A graph showing the change in air-pressure (also known as
sound intensity) over time.<br>

Microphone - A device that turns changes in air-pressure (sound) into
changes in electrical voltage.<br>

Speaker - A device that turns changes in electrical voltage into
changes in air-pressure (sound).<br>

Cycle - The change in air pressure from a starting point up to a higher
value, down to a lower value, and then back to the initial value.&nbsp;
One cycle is one sound wave.<br>

Hertz - The number of cycles per second, abbreviated Hz.&nbsp; <br>

Pure Tone - A sound composed solely of identical waves at the same
frequency.<br>

Amplitude - The height of each wave, measured from the low point to the
high point.<br>

Intensity - The strength of the sound, determined by the wave's
amplitude.<br>

Decibel - The scale that is used to measure sound, abbreviated dB.<br>

Analog to Digital Conversion - Changing information from an analog
(electrical voltage) to a digital data, abbreviated A-D, A to D, ADC.<br>

Digital to Analog Conversion - Changing information from digital data
to an analog output (electrical voltage), abbreviated D-A, D to A, DAC.<br>

Sample - Each time an A-D conversion happens, the value of the analog
signal is stored and referred to as a single sample.<br>

Quantization - The general name for storing analog signals as digital
data.<br>

Pulse Code Modulation - The most popular method for storing the analog
signals of audio in the digital form.&nbsp; This gives each pulse (or
sample) a code based on the number of available bits.&nbsp; <br>

Sample Depth - The number of bits used to encode each sample.&nbsp; <br>

Sample Frequency - The number of samples that are taken ever
second.&nbsp; <br>

Channel - One microphone's audio recording.&nbsp; Two channels can be
combined for stereo sound, six channels can be combined for surround
sound.<br>

Track - A recording of one channel.<br>

Bit Rate - The number of bits per second that are used to store the
audio as digital data.<br>

Constant Bit Rate - Every portion of the recording is encoded at the
same rate.<br>

Variable Bit Rate - The bit rate of the recording can change throughout
the recording so that parts that are complicated can use more bits and
parts that are simple can use less bits, while maintaining the same
overall bit rate.<br>

Rip - Take the data off of a CD (or DVD) and store it to the hard disk.<br>

Burn - Write data to a CD (or DVD).<br>

Silence - An absence of audio (no pressure waves causing changes).<br>

Shift - A tool in audacity that can be used to move selections forward
or backward in time.<br>

Envelope - A tool in audacity that can be applied across an audio track
to increase or decrease the intensity for various spots.<br>

Amplify - Increase (or decrease) the intensity of a selection.<br>

Fade - Have a sound gradually come up from silence (fade in) or go down
to silence (fade out).<br>

Compress - Make the audio intensity use a smaller range.<br>

Pitch - The tone of the sound.<br>

Tempo - The speed at which the beat of the sound comes.<br>

Podcast - An episodic audio show, that can be automatically downloaded
to many listener's computers.<br>

XML - eXtensible Markup Language, a way of representing data as text,
using tags for data types.<br>

RSS - Really Simple Syndication, the XML format used for feeds of
podcasts, blogs, news streams, etc.<br>

Show Notes - A set of information with items of interest from a podcast
episode.<br>

Stream - Audio or video that is coming over the internet that can be
heard immediately after it arrives (as opposed to a download where you
wait for it to complete).<br>
