<h2 class="western">About this Material</h2>

<p>This material was originally developed for the Instituto San Jose
Sebastian Pelczar in Montero, Bolivia for a course covering an
introduction to
multimedia design. The original course was in Spanish, but as the
teacher was a native English speaker, the materials were first
prepared in English, then translated to Spanish. </p>
