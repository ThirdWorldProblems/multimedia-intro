<h2 class="western">Attribution</h2>


This is a class that deals with editing media works, not creating
originals.&nbsp; As such we generally will not be taking photos,
filming video, capturing audio, etc.&nbsp; For most of the work in this
class, we will be using examples prepared specifically for the
course.&nbsp; However, we may also use material found on the
internet.&nbsp; <br>


<br>


<span style="font-weight: bold;">For all source material used the
student MUST attribute the usage to the original source.</span>&nbsp;
This is done in the following format, with each piece of data separated
by commas:<br>


<br>


[Name or Description of Material], [Author's Name or the words "No
author
could be identified"], [the source of the media], [the license that
allows
you to use this media]<br>


<br>


For example<br>


<ul>
<li>Inkscape Icon, CyberSkull, <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Inkscape_OS_X.png">http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Inkscape_OS_X.png</a>,
GPL</li><li>Ending the dive-- ascending
to the sunlight, OAR/National Undersea Research Program, <a href="http://www.photolib.noaa.gov/htmls/nur05549.htm">http://www.photolib.noaa.gov/htmls/nur05549.htm</a>,
US Government Public

  </li><li>Sunset, No author could be identified,
http://randomwebsite.com/sunset.jpg, CC-BY-SA</li><li>Heavenly Sunlight, Henry J. Zelly, <a href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/music/Heavenly_Sunlight/">http://library.timelesstruths.org/music/Heavenly_Sunlight/</a>,

  </li>
</ul>


Name/Description - This is usually something that can be found easily
if you download the material from the internet.&nbsp; If one is not
available, or if you have two different pieces of material with the
same name in your project, write something that will describe it
uniquely.<br>


Author's Name - This is generally found with the material if you are
downloading it from the web.&nbsp; This can be an individual (Thomas
Kent), a screen name (teeks99), or a group/organization (NASA).&nbsp;
If you are not able to find an author for your material, you may put
the words "No author could be identified" here. <br>


Location - For items found on the internet, this would be the web
address or Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the material.&nbsp; If it
is not found on the internet, please describe the source.<br>


License - This is probably the most important part.&nbsp; This is where
you identify why it is allowable for you to use this material in your
project.&nbsp; See more on licenses in the next section.<br>


<br>


It is essential that all material used in this course have an
attribution that is submitted with the project.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Any projects that have material which is
not correctly attributed will have credit deducted. </span><br>


<h3 class="western">
Licenses</h3>


All media that is created is immediately and automatically granted a
copyright to the creator of that material (also called a "creative
work" or just "work").&nbsp; This copyright allows the author to
control the use of that creative work by requiring that anyone who
wants to use the work have a license for that work.&nbsp; <br>


<br style="font-weight: bold;">


Let me repeat that one more time because it is important, <span style="font-weight: bold;">when a
person creates a creative work: a picture, song, video, etc. they are
automatically given a copyright on that.&nbsp; Therefore any material
found online, on a CD/DVD, in a magazine, etc is copyrighted by someone
else!</span><br>


<br>


If the work
is used without a license, the author can sue the person who used it
illegally for hundreds of times the amount that the work is valued
at.&nbsp; Because of this, it is essential that you have a license to
use any works that you incorporate into your projects during this
course.&nbsp; In addition, and projects that you do will automatically
be copyrighted to you!&nbsp; However, as the teacher, I will require
you license the works to me for use in grading and use in class. For
more info see: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright</a><br>


<br>


Because it would be very difficult to contact the author directly every
time you need to use material in your creative works, there are a set
of licenses that are setup that authors can attach to a work that allow
anybody to re-use them in ceritan ways.&nbsp; These licenses are
generally called "Creative Commons" Licenses, and are administered by
the Creative Commons orginization.&nbsp; <br>


<br>


The Creative Commons licenses share a set of four basic components
(plus a few more for special cases):<br>


<table style="border-spacing: 1em;">

<br>


These components are combined together to create a creative commons
license.&nbsp; The important ones and their abbreviations are:<br>


Attribution (CC-BY)<br>


Attribution - Share Alike (CC-BY-SA)<br>


Attribution - Noncommercial (CC-BY-NC)<br>


Attribution - Share Alike - Noncommercial (CC-BY-SA-NC)<br>


Attribution - No Derivative (CC-BY-ND)&nbsp; (Note, this one probably
can't be used in this course)<br>


Find out more about them at: <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/licenses/">http://creativecommons.org/about/licenses/</a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_licenses">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_licenses</a><br>


<br>


In addition to these creative commons licenses, some media content is
also made available under licenses generally used by open source
software.<br>


GNU General Public License (GPL) - This requires that if you use the
work in your work, you make your work available under the GPL as
well.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html</a><br>


GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) - You may use works licensed
under this in your work, however if you make changes to the original
work they must be made available under the LGPL.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html</a><br>


Apache/MIT - Very similar to the LGPL <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0</a><br>


GNU Free Documentation License (FDL) - Same as the GPL, but
specifically oriented towards documentation. <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl.html">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl.html</a><br>


<br>


In general the recommendation for this course is to use the CC-BY-SA
license on any material you create.&nbsp; For an example of how to do
that, see the beginning of this document.<br>


<h3>Public Domain</h3>


When content, for whatever reason, does not have a copyright that needs
to be licensed it is said to be in the "Public Domain".&nbsp; Any work
in this state can be used by anyone for whatever purpose without any
requirement to license or notify the author.&nbsp; However, it is still
recommended to attribute the original work to that author.&nbsp; There
are two general ways that things get into the public domain: they are
either put there explicitly by their creator or they reach the limit on
the number of years that their copyright applies.&nbsp; The length that
a copyright will last on a work varies from country to country, but is
usually multiple decades long. In the United States this is at least 70
years.<br>


Some governments such as the United States are obligated by law to put
the works they create into the public domain.&nbsp; For this reason you
will find many works from groups such as NASA, NOAA, and even the IRS
in the public domain (there are some exceptions to this however).<br>


For more info see: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain</a><br>


<h3>Fair Use</h3>


Even when a work is not available under one of the above licenses or in
the public domain, there are certain, very limited, ways that you can
use the work without having to worry about the license.&nbsp; These are
generally termed "Fair Use", and the rules on this vary greatly from
country to country.&nbsp; <br>


In general the following are legitimate uses: commentary, criticism,
news reporting, research, teaching, library archiving and
scholarship.&nbsp; However, there are several restrictions on these
uses.&nbsp; The purpose of the new work must transform the original
work, it can not simply be using the success of the original to create
success for the new work.&nbsp;&nbsp; You generally can not use the
whole of a work, it is acceptable to use a clip of a movie in a parody,
but you cannot include the whole movie in it.&nbsp; Finally, the new
work should not seriously harm the market for the original work.&nbsp; <br>


<br>


It may be noted that most of the works used in projects for this course
could be claimed as fair use, as they are being used for scholarship in
an academic institution.&nbsp; This is true, however as this is a
course in multimedia creation, one aspect is teaching the correct use
of copyright and licensing. So, <span style="font-weight: bold;">for
the attribution required for each work in this course, "Fair Use" is
not an acceptable license description</span>.<br>
