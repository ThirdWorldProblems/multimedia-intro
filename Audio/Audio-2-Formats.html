<h2>Formats</h2>Audio can be stored in either an uncompressed format,
or a compressed format.&nbsp; Unlike photos though, these do not always
signify that it is a lossless or lossy recording.&nbsp; For example, an
audio recording could be stored in an uncompressed format, but its
sample frequency could be lowered to get into that format, making it
lossy.&nbsp; Likewise, there are compressed formats that are lossless,
where they make the size of the data smaller, while still retaining all
the information about the audio.&nbsp; Finally, there are compressed
and lossy formats, these are the most common for use among consumers of
audio.<br>


<h3>Uncompressed Formats</h3>


<p>Digital audio has a few, very common uncompressed formats that it
can use.&nbsp; They take PCM audio with the parameters described above,
and wrap it up into a neat file.&nbsp; The two main formats you will
find are CD Audio and WAV.&nbsp;You will often find other formats that
simply
specify a PCM type (linear, mu-Law, A-Law), a size (8-bit, 16-bit,
24-bit,
etc), signed or unsigned, a frequency (32kHz, 44.1kHz, 48kHz), endianess (big or
little), number of channels, and bit-rate.&nbsp; </p>

<p>CD Audio - The most common format you will find is CD audio, it is
uncompressed audio.&nbsp; This format is 16-bit, Linear Pulse Code
Modulation (L-PCM), signed data, running at a 44.1kHz sampling rate,
with two channels of audio (stereo).&nbsp; It runs at 1411kbps&nbsp; 
</p>

WAV - Unlike CD Audio, that specifies exact parameters, WAV files are
capable of containing many different formats, however the most common
one that it contains is identical to the CD audio format: 16-bit,
L-PCM, signed, 44.1kHz.&nbsp; WAV files are almost always found with
uncompressed data, however it is possible to use compression inside
them.<br>
<br>
AUP - This is the format that is used internally by audacity.&nbsp;
When you save a project in audacity, it creates a file with a .aup
extension as well as a directory with the same name which stores all
your raw audio.&nbsp; By default this is 44.1kHz 32-bit float data, but
that can be changed in the preferences.<br>

<br>

<h3>Compressed Formats</h3>Digital audio can take up quite a bit of
space.&nbsp; Lets look at
typical CD audio: 16-bit samples multiplied by 44.1kHz multiplied by
two channels gives 1,411,200 bits/second.&nbsp; This is equal to
176,400 Bytes/second or 176KB/s or 10.6MB/min or 635MB/hr.&nbsp; These
numbers will look nice and tame when we get to the raw video rates in
the next section, but they are still a lot to store, especially when a
lot of that space is basically redundant.&nbsp; There are a few
compression formats that use lossless compression, so that no
information is lost.&nbsp; The leading one of these is called FLAC, but
there are also others from Apple and Microsoft.&nbsp; When using a
lossless compression format, you can typically compress the audio down
to about half of the original size.&nbsp; However, the
majority of audio formats are lossy formats.&nbsp; The are used for
everything from the audio on your DVD and BluRay disk, to MP3 players
like the iPod and cellphones, and even podcasts and skype.&nbsp; When
using some of the better lossy compression formats, you can
usually re-produce the audio so that it sounds almost excatly the same,
using only about 10-20% of the original size.

<p>MP2 - Stands for MPEG-1 audio, layer 2.&nbsp; Often used in
broadcasting.<br>
</p>

<p>MP3 - Stands for MPEG-1 audio, layer 3.&nbsp; This is the most
popular audio format, as is evidenced by the number of MP3 players
available at electronics stores.&nbsp; Almost all computers and
consumer audio players can play this format.&nbsp; However, this format
is older and Vorbis, AAC, and WMA all offer superior compression ratios
for the same quality audio.<br>
</p>

<p>AC3 - This is also known as Dolby Digital sound, made popular by its
use in movie theaters.&nbsp; It is used on many DVDs and supports 5.1
channel sound.&nbsp; <br>
</p>

<p>FLAC - Free Lossless Audio Codec.&nbsp; This audio format was made
to take uncompressed formats and shrink them down, without losing any
quality at all.&nbsp; Audio in this format can be converted back to an
uncompressed format, and the resulting file would be identical to the
original uncompressed file.&nbsp; This is often used for editing and
archival, where you want to be sure not to lose any information.&nbsp;
Files are usually about half the size of an uncompressed file.&nbsp;
This format is open source, and free of royalties, so it can be used
anywhere.<br>
</p>

<p>Ogg/Vorbis - This is the leading open source compressed audio
format.&nbsp; Its compression is approximately twice as good as MP3, and
on par with AAC or WMA compression.&nbsp; This is the official standard for audio used in web pages.<br>
</p>

<p>AAC - Advanced Audio Codec&nbsp; This is Apple's primary audio
codec. It is available on Macintosh, in iTunes, and on
iPods/iPhones.&nbsp; <br>
</p>

<p>WMA - Windows Media Audio.&nbsp; This is Microsoft's primary audio
codec.&nbsp; It is available on Windows computers and many portable
devices.<br>
</p>

Speex - This is a codec that was developed specifically for compressing
human voices.&nbsp; It is not a high fidelity codec, and should not be
used with music or sound effects, but is good at accurately
re-producing the human voice.
