<h3>Uncompressed Formats</h3>

<p>Digital audio has a few, very common uncompressed formats that it
can use.&nbsp; They take PCM audio with the paramaters described above,
and wrap it up into a neat file.&nbsp; The two main formats you will
find are CD Audio and WAV.&nbsp;You will often find other formats that
simply
specify a PCM type (linear, mu-Law, A-Law), a size (8-bit, 16-bit,
24-bit,
etc), signed or unsigned, a frequency (32, 44.1, 48), endianess (big or
little), number of channels, and bit-rate.&nbsp; </p>

<p>CD Audio - The most common format you will find is CD audio, it is
uncompressed audio.&nbsp; This format is 16-bit, Linear Pulse Code
Modulation (L-PCM), signed data, running at a 44.1kHz sampling rate,
with two channels of audio (stereo).&nbsp; It runs at 146KB/s.&nbsp; <br>
</p>

WAV - Unlike CD Audio, that specifies exact paramaters, WAV files are
capable of contaning many different formats, however the most common
one that it contains is identical to the CD audio format: 16-bit,
L-PCM, signed, 44.1kHz.&nbsp; WAV files are almost always found with
uncompressed data, however it is possible to use compression inside
them.<br>

<h3>Compressed Formats</h3>

Digital audio can take up quite a bit of space.&nbsp; Lets look at
typical CD audio: 16-bit samples multiplied by 44.1kHz multiplied by
two channels gives 1,411,200 bits/second.&nbsp; This is equal to
176,400 Bytes/second or 176KB/s or 10.6MB/min or 635MB/hr.&nbsp; These
numbers will look nice and tame when we get to the raw video rates in
the next section, but they are still a lot to store, especially when a
lot of that space is basically redundant.&nbsp; There are a few
compression formats that use lossless compression, so that no
information is lost.&nbsp; The leading one of these is called FLAC, but
there are also others from Apple and Microsoft.&nbsp; However, the
majority of audio formats are lossy formats.&nbsp; The are used for
everything from the audio on your DVD and BluRay disk, to MP3 players
like the iPod and cellphones, and even podcasts and skype. <br>

<p>MP2 - Stands for MPEG-1 audio, layer 2.&nbsp; Often used in
broadcasting.<br>
</p>

<p>MP3 - Stands for MPEG-1 audio, layer 3.&nbsp; This is the most
popular audio format, as is evidinced by the number of MP3 players
available at electronics stores.&nbsp; Almost all computers and
consumer audio players can play this format.&nbsp; <br>
</p>

<p>AC3 - This is also known as Dolby Digital sound, made popular by its
use in movie theaters.&nbsp; It is used on many DVDs and supports 5.1
channel sound.&nbsp; <br>
</p>

<p>FLAC - Free Lossless Audio Codec.&nbsp; This audio format was made
to take uncompressed formats and shrink them down, without losing any
quality at all.&nbsp; Audio in this format can be converted back to an
uncompressed format, and the resulting file would be identical to the
original uncompressed file.&nbsp; This is often used for editing and
archival, where you want to be sure not to lose any information.&nbsp;
Files are usually about half the size of an uncompressed file.&nbsp;
This format is open source, and free of royalties, so it can be used
anywhere.<br>
</p>

<p>Ogg/Vorbis - This is the leanding open source compressed audio
format.&nbsp; Its compression is aproximately twice as good as MP3, and
on par with AAC or WMA compression.&nbsp; <br>
</p>

<p>AAC - Advanced Audio Codec&nbsp; This is Apple's primary audio
codec. It is available on Macintosh, in iTunes, and on
iPods/iPhones.&nbsp; <br>
</p>

<p>WMA - Windows Media Audio.&nbsp; This is microsoft's primary audio
codec.&nbsp; It is available on Windows computers and many portable
devices.<br>
</p>

Speex - This is a codec that was developed specifically for compressing
human voices.&nbsp; It is not a high fidelity codec, and should not be
used with music or sound effects, but is good at accurately
re-producing the human voice.
