<h2>Live Audio (and Video)<br>
</h2>

The other way that audio shows are distributed online, other than in
podcast form, is live streams.&nbsp; Live streams are where the audio
is broadcast to listeners at the same time as it happens.&nbsp; When
the show host says something, everyone listening to it hears it at the
same time.&nbsp; This makes shows where listeners interact with the
show possible.&nbsp; Since this is only an introduction to multimedia,
we're not going to do any examples on this topic, we're just going to
go through some of the basics here.&nbsp; In addition, the concepts
behind live video are very similar to live audio (except it takes A LOT
more bandwidth) so we'll throw that in here as well, even though we
haven't covered the section on video yet.<br>
<h3>

Live Streams</h3>
The first thing you need when setting up a live audio/video show is a
way to transmit your show out to the user.&nbsp; There are many
different formats that support this, and each format also has companies
that will give (usually with ads) or sell usage of their product.&nbsp;
Here are some of the most popular options:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Shoutcast/Icecast</span> - This is the
most popular audio streaming (Icecast can support video, but usually
does not), there are litterally thousands of audio streams from
individuals as well as organizations such as radio stations that use
this.&nbsp; The format (also called shoutcast) was originally developed
by the company Nullsoft (now owned by AOL) who popularized it with
their shoutcast server (<a href="http://shoutcast.com">http://shoutcast.com</a>).&nbsp; Icecast (<a href="http://icecast.org">http://icecast.org</a>)
was created as a full-featured, open source replacement for the
shoutcast software, which is easy to setup and free to use.&nbsp; Now
Icecast and Shoutcast are used in about even numbers.&nbsp; Icecast is
the recommended solution if you only want to stream audio.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Real Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) / Flash Streaming</span>
- Currently Flash audio and video streaming is very popular on the
internet.&nbsp; The biggest reason that it has become so popular is
that almost all web browsers have the flash player built into them, so
no additional software was needed to start watching the streams.&nbsp;
There are several services that provide this for free the most popular
of which are Ustream (<a href="http://ustream.tv">http://ustream.tv</a>) and Justin.tv (<a href="http://justin.tv">http://justin.tv</a>).&nbsp;
These allow you to connect a microphone/camera or complete audio/video
feed to their streaming application and broadcast, for free with ads on
the internet, without having to setup any hardware or software
yourself.&nbsp; For a begenning experiment with streaming on the web,
this is a quick and easy way to get started.&nbsp; There are also more
professional products that allow for streaming of RTMP which allow you
to run your own server.&nbsp; Adobe, being the maker of the Flash
software and RTMP protocol has the most popular server, in its Adobe
Flash Streaming server.&nbsp; However, there is an open source
competitor that is completely free to use and easy to setup called Red5
(<a href="http://red5.org">http://red5.org</a>).<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Windows Media Server</span>
- This is the server software that is used to stream Windows Media
audio and video to Windows Media Player clients.&nbsp; Unfortunately
this really only works well if all the users have Microsoft Windows, as
it isn't directly supported on Mac or Linux.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Helix/Real Media</span> - Real Media
was the number one streaming media solution before any of the other
solutions on this list, however it has fallen behind the other
options.&nbsp; Today it is used mostly in corporate settings.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Quicktime / Darwin Media Server (Apple QuickTime)</span>
- Both these options are products of Apple, built to work with the
QuickTime media player.&nbsp; However, the Darwin Media Server has been
released as open source, and is freely available.&nbsp; In addition to
working with QuickTime video, it can work with some of the bigger
Audio/Video standards (H.264, MPEG-4 Part 2, 3gp).&nbsp; <br>
