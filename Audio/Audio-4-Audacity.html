<h2>Audacity - Recording and Playback</h2>
Audacity is a professional grade audio editor and recorder.&nbsp; It is
realitively easy to get started with, but has many complicated and
powerful features available to professionals.<br>
<br>
<h3>
Import audio</h3>
The first thing you need to start using audacity is some audio.&nbsp;
There are two ways to get audio into audacity, record it from a
microphone (more on that in a bit) or import an existing track.&nbsp;
For now, lets use the import feature to get <a href="Audio/sintel_trailer-audio.flac">this FLAC encoded track</a> into audacity.<br>
<br>
Once you've saved the file to the disk, open Audacity and select File
-&gt; Import -&gt; Audio... and choose the file from your disk.&nbsp;
It will take a second to convert the file from FLAC to the native
editing format (44.1kHz, 32-bit float), then you will see its
"waveform" in the window.<br>

<h3>Play Back Audio</h3>
Once you have it open, you can play it back to hear what it sounds
like.&nbsp; Just click the green play button, to start.&nbsp; The blue
pause button to the left of the play button will halt the
playback.&nbsp; The yellow stop button to the right of the play button
will stop playback and re-set it to the begenning.<br>

You will see that the cursor moves along with the audio as it is
played.&nbsp; Just under the play button is a slider that will let you
control the volume of the playback.&nbsp; On the same line as the play
button, but further to the right you will see two green bars (labled
L&amp;R for Left and Right channels) which show the level of volume
that is being played at that instant.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<h3>

Record audio</h3>
The other way to get audio into audacity is to record it.&nbsp; First,
lets remove the track we imported previously.&nbsp; Just click the "X"
in the upper left corner of the track's window.&nbsp; Now you should
have a blank audacity window to record into.&nbsp; When you are ready,
push the record button then start talking into your microphone.&nbsp; <br>
<img src="AudioScreen/Audacity-Record.png" alt="Audacity-Record.png"><br>
This time you will see the cursor be a bit ahead of the graph showing
the waveform.&nbsp; That is because it takes the computer a short
amount of time to process the audio it is recording and display
it.&nbsp; Be aware that the location of the cursor is where you are at
in the timeline, not where the graph of the waveform is showing
up.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
You will also notice that there are two bars (red this time) to the
right of where the volume was displayed during playback.&nbsp; This
shows the level of volume of the audio being recorded at that
instant.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Finally, there is a slider under the record button that allows you to
change the strength that the microphone records at.&nbsp; Unfortunately
if you are running Ubuntu, this won't work.&nbsp; Instead, set this in
the Sound Preferences on the Input tab.<br>
<h3>Save AUP (AUdacity Project) File</h3>

Now that we have the start of an audio project we will want to work
with, we need to save the project so we can open it later.&nbsp; To
save the entire project, go to File -&gt; Save Project As...&nbsp; When
you pick a file name with the .aup extension, audacity will
automatically create a directory at the same location as the .aup file,
with the same name as what is before the .aup.&nbsp; This directory
contains the actual audio data so <span style="font-weight: bold;">it is very important</span>.&nbsp;
Do not delete this while trying to cleanup a directory.&nbsp; If you
move the .aup file to a different location, you need to move this
directory as well.&nbsp; <br>
<h3>
Export Audio Files</h3>

At this point we could go on editing our project, adding more audio,
etc. During this process we would be continueously saving the .aup file
(in case our computer crashes).&nbsp;&nbsp; In the end though, we want
to get our final result back out in a format that we can listen to
(WAV, FLAC, OGG-Vorbis, MP3, etc).&nbsp; Note: AUP files are not
something that you can listen to in a media player, they are a special
audacity format (similar to XCF files for the GIMP).&nbsp; To create
the more normal file types, we will use the "Export" function.&nbsp; Go
to File -&gt; Export and selecty the type of file you would like from
the drop down on the bottom (FLAC is the recommended format), then
enter a file name and click "Save".<br>
