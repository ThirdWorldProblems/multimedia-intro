<h2>Channels</h2>

<h3>
Stereo Recording</h3>

Most consumer level microphones will only record in one channel of
audio (mono), so it is just a waste of space to record that input to a
stereo recording, you don't gain any new detail in the audio and it
will sound exactly the same as a mono recording when played back.&nbsp;
That said, there are microphones available that do record two
channels.&nbsp; If you require this, you can set the number of channels
to record under the Edit -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Devices menu for the
specific device that will support multi-channel recording.<br>

<br>

<h3>Mixing Audio Sources</h3>

More common than having a single device that records in stereo, is
having multiple devices recording different sounds.&nbsp; An example
could be a radio or tv talk show where the host is one channel of
audio, and each guest has their own channel of audio.&nbsp; Another
example would be recording a band playing, where each musician and/or
insturament has its own track of audio.&nbsp; There are ways to record
this in audacity (with the help of the JACK audio routing software on
linux), but we won't go into them here.&nbsp; <br>

<br>

Instead, we'll start with a scenario where there are several
independant tracks of audio that have already been recorded, and need
to be edited together into one piece of audio.&nbsp; <br>

<br>

There is one track for each person talking, you can download them <a href="Audio/MalePart-NoNoise-Start.flac">here</a> (<a href="Audio/MalePart-NoNoise-Start-es.flac">es</a>)
and <a href="Audio/FemalePart-NoNoise.flac">here</a> (<a href="Audio/FemalePart-NoNoise-es.flac">es</a>).&nbsp; Below is a
transcript of
the audio:<br>

<br>

F: Hi there<br>

M: Hi<br>

F: How are you doing?<br>

M: I'm fine, how are you?<br>

F: Fine as well.&nbsp; What are you doing now?<br>

M: I'm reading a book, why?<br>

F: Do you want to go to the zoo with me?<br>

M: Sure, that sounds fun.<br>

<br>

M: Hola <br>

H: Hola <br>

M: Como estas?<br>

H: Estoy bien, y tu?<br>

M: Estoy bien tambien.&nbsp; Que haces ahorita?<br>

H: Estoy leyendo un libro.&nbsp; Por que?<br>

M: Quieres ir al parque zoologico con migo?<br>

H: Si, que divertido. <br>

<br>

Once you have the first clip open in audacity, open the second one by
going to File -&gt; Import -&gt; Audio... and selecting the second clip
from your hard drive.&nbsp; Now they should both be open, try playing
them back together by pushing the play button.&nbsp; <br>

You'll notice that they don't line up.&nbsp; The two subjects are
talking over each other.&nbsp; This is a common occourance when
recording multi-track audio, as each track may not start the recording
at the same spot.&nbsp; To fix this we will have to synchronize (sync)
them manually.&nbsp; But before we do that, lets give these tracks
names so we can keep track of them (this is even more important when
you have lots of tracks), to do this, click on the drop down arrow for
the track, and select Name.&nbsp; For the female track name it "Female"
and for the male track, name it "Male".&nbsp; <br>

In addition, now would be a good time to save the audacity project as a
.aup file and directory.&nbsp; <br>

<br>

<br>

<h3>Shift Tool</h3>

Now we're ready to sync the audio so that the final result has the two
subjects talking to each other at the correct times.&nbsp; Select the
Time Shift Tool from just below and to the right of the selection tool.<br>

<img src="AudioScreen/Audacity-TimeShiftTool.png" alt="Audacity-TimeShiftTool.png"><br>

<br>

Then it is as simple as clicking on the track you want to move, and
dragging it to the correct spot.&nbsp; In this case, lets move the male
track (because the female track talks first).&nbsp; Just move it so
that on the waveform the first male response lines up in the gap
between the first and second female responses.<br>

<br>

<br>

If you try playing it back at this point you will notice that it starts
out lined up, but then later on in the recording it gets out of
wack.&nbsp; There are several possible reasons this could happen, but
in this case it is because these tracks were done in two seperate
takes, with only one person's voice being recorded each time.&nbsp;
Because they had no frame of reference the same tempo wasn't kept both
times.&nbsp;&nbsp; To fix this, we will have to add in extra space to
the blank areas to make up the difference.&nbsp; Simply click at the
spot where you want to add space to put the cursor there, the select
Generate -&gt; Silence, then type the number of seconds you want to add
(try something small like 0.5 to start with, you may need to select a
different option from the drop down to pick a unit that has fractions
of seconds, such as hh:mm:ss+hundredths) and click OK.&nbsp; <br>

<br>

<img src="AudioScreen/Audacity-InsertSilence.png" alt="Audacity-InsertSilence.png"><br>

<br>

Listen to the result to see if it sounds better, if it needs more go
back and do it again.&nbsp; Repeat for each section that doesn't line
up, moving
from left to right in the two tracks.&nbsp; If you were to start at the
right and move to the left, each change you made would throw off those
that you had done previously.<br>

<br>

Another way to sync audio is to do it from the begenning.&nbsp; This
time the two subjects were recorded in the same take, from two
different microphones.&nbsp; <br>
<h3>Too Much Audio</h3>

You may have noticed that in some cases the male microphone picked up
the female talking and the female microphone picked up the male
talking.&nbsp; This is a farily common occourance.&nbsp; We want to
remove this, because if the same audio shows up at a time that is even
a split second different, it can drastically change the final audio
(possibly sound like an echo or reverberation).&nbsp; Below are the
areas in this clip where this is happening.<br>

<br>

<img src="AudioScreen/Audacity-WrongChannel.png" alt="Audacity-WrongChannel.png"><br>

<br>

One way to fix this would be to use the "Silence Audio" functionality
that we used in the last section.&nbsp; Its usefulness is obvious here,
if we were to simply cut out the additional audio from the tracks,
their duration would change, and it wouldn't be possible to match them
up.&nbsp; Instead, we can go, select each area and then run "Silence
Audio".&nbsp; <br>

<br>

Another option to fix this would be to use the Envelope Tool.&nbsp; The
Envelope Tool allows you to create a graphical envelope around the
waveform which indicates the volume for that area.&nbsp; This allows
you to simply turn down the volume only for areas that we don't want to
hear, while leaving other areas normal.&nbsp; <br>

<h3>Creating a stereo track</h3>

Now that we have two good tracks, one for each speaker, one thing we
can set them up to output a stereo track that has one person talking
from each channel.&nbsp; That would make it sound like one person is
taking from the left and the other is talking from the right.<br>
