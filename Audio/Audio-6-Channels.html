  <title>Audio - 6 - Channels</title>

  
</head><body>
<h2>Channels</h2>
<h3>
Stereo Recording</h3>

Most consumer level microphones will only record in one channel of
audio (mono), so it is just a waste of space to record that input to a
stereo recording, you don't gain any new detail in the audio and it
will sound exactly the same as a mono recording when played back.&nbsp;
That said, there are microphones available that do record two
channels.&nbsp; If you require this, you can set the number of channels
to record under the Edit -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Devices menu for the
specific device that will support multi-channel recording.<br>

<br>
<h3>Mixing Audio Sources</h3>
More common than having a single device that records in stereo, is
having multiple devices recording different sounds.&nbsp; An example
could be a radio or tv talk show where the host is one channel of
audio, and each guest has their own channel of audio.&nbsp; Another
example would be recording a band playing, where each musician and/or
insturament has its own track of audio.&nbsp; There are ways to record
this in audacity (with the help of the JACK audio routing software on
linux), but we won't go into them here.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Instead, we'll start with a scenario where there are several
independant tracks of audio that have already been recorded, and need
to be edited together into one piece of audio.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
There is one track for each person talking, you can download them here and here.&nbsp; Below is a transcript of the audio:<br>
<br>
L: Hi Tom<br>
T: Hi Laura<br>
L: How are you doing?<br>
T: I'm fine, how are you?<br>
L: Fine as well.&nbsp; What are you doing now?<br>
T: I'm reading a book, why?<br>
L: Do you want to go to the zoo with me?<br>
T: Sure, that sounds fun.<br>
<br>
L: Hola Tom<br>
T: Hola Laura<br>
L: Como estas?<br>
