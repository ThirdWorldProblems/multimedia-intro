<h2>Filtering and Effects</h2>Filters and Effects describe almost any action that can be taken on all or part of an audio track, that changes how it sounds.&nbsp; These can be as simple as making it louder or complex such as Point Cast Distortion.&nbsp; There are over 125 different effects that come with Audacity, and even more can be found online.<br><br>The use of all of these filters, unless otherwise specified, acts on a selection of audio.&nbsp; You can use the selection tool to make selections by clicking and draging over the area on the waveform you want to select.&nbsp; To select the entire audio track(s) you can press Ctrl+A.<br><br>For these examples, lets start by downloading the <a href="Audio/MalePart.flac">male track</a> from last time.<br><h3>Amplification</h3>The most basic task that you would typically come across when working with an audio track would be to raise or lower (amplify) the volume for a portion of the track.&nbsp; You may remember from the last section, that it is possible to raise or lower the volume of an entire track by using the slider to the left of the track, however that won't work for only a portion of the track.&nbsp; <br><br>Lets make a selection and then go to to Effect -&gt; Amplify.&nbsp; <br><img src="AudioScreen/Audacity-AmplifyEffect.png" alt="Audacity-AmplifyEffect.png"><br><br>You will have to choose an amount of aplification in dBs.&nbsp; Zero dBs won't change the selection, something greater than zero will raise the volume, something lower than zero will lower it.&nbsp; It is possible to slide it so far to the right that part of the audio goes beyond what is capable of being played back (past 1.0 on the scale), this is called clipping.&nbsp; You can check the box to allow it if this is what you want, but it will sound bad.&nbsp; <br><br>Here is what it looks like with a rather large amplification.&nbsp; Normally this would probably be far too much, but it was exagerated for the sake of emphasis.<br><img src="AudioScreen/Audacity-AmplifyAfter.png" alt="Audacity-AmplifyAfter.png"><br><br>That's all there is to amplification.&nbsp; <br><h3>Noise Removal</h3>You may have noticed that in this clip, there is a substantial buzz/hum in the background.&nbsp; This is annoying and makes it harder to listen to, so we would like to remove this.&nbsp; For the areas where there is only the background noise but no talking we could just use the silence or envelope tool to remove them, but unfortunately (as is common) the background noise continues even when the person is talking.&nbsp; To remove this from everywhere, including the important audio, we'll use the noise removal filter.<br><br>We'll start by selecting an area of the audio that ONLY has the background noise.&nbsp; It is important that there isn't any other noise here, as the filter will create a profile based on this, that will be applied to the whole clip.&nbsp; Once we have our selection, go to Effect -&gt; Noise Removal.<br><img src="AudioScreen/Audacity-NoiseRemovalProfile.png" alt="Audacity-NoiseRemovalProfile.png"><br>Click "Get Noise Profile" to use the selected area as the profile.<br><br>Now we'll go back and select the area that we want to remove the backgroung noise from (probably the whole clip) and go back to the Noise Removal effect.&nbsp; We're now in step two, applying the filter.&nbsp; We can probably just leave the settings at their defaults of 24db, 150Hz, and 0.15s.&nbsp; And hit OK.<br><img src="AudioScreen/Audacity-NoiseRemovalAfter.png" alt="Audacity-NoiseRemovalAfter.png"><br>Listen to it to hear the differnce (hit Ctrl+Z to go back and hear the old one too).&nbsp; If you turn the volume up, you can still hear some noise in the quiet parts, but it is much better now, and not noticable during the talking.&nbsp; If you want to fix up the quiet parts further, you can use the silence or envelope tools.<br><h3>Fade In/Out</h3>For the next couple sections, we're going to need just a short clip of audio.&nbsp; To get it, open the sintel trailer, and create a selection that starts at 17 seconds in and goes for 15 seconds.&nbsp; (Hint: use the selection bar below the waveforms)<br><img src="AudioScreen/Audacity-SmallSelection.png" alt="Audacity-SmallSelection.png"><br>Once we have our selection, we'll cut everything else, so that we only have our selection remaining.&nbsp; Instead of using the normal cut button, we can use the trim button to remove everything else in the clip.<br><img style="width: 903px; height: 581px;" src="AudioScreen/Audacity-Trim.png" alt="Audacity-Trim.png"><br>Finally, use the time shift tool to move it to the begenning.<br><img src="AudioScreen/Audacity-ShortSelectionStart.png" alt="Audacity-ShortSelectionStart.png"><br>(Now would be a good time to save your work)<br><br>Now that we're all set, we can start editing this clip to make it sound good.&nbsp; One of the first things we notice when we listen to it, is that it starts and stops very suddenly.&nbsp; To smooth out that transition, we'll use the Fade In and Fade Out effects.&nbsp; <br><br>To start using the Fade In effect, we will select the area we want to apply it to. It doesn't take much time to make a good fade in, so lets select the first half second or so.&nbsp; <br><img src="AudioScreen/Audacity-FadeInSelect.png" alt="Audacity-FadeInSelect.png"><br>Now that we've got it selected, run Effects -&gt; Fade In.<br><img src="AudioScreen/Audacity-FadeIn.png" alt="Audacity-FadeIn.png"><br>You can listen to the start of the clip and hear a big difference in the two starts.&nbsp; Our new one with the Fade In is much smoother.<br><br>For the fade out, we'll make it a bit more gradual (because there's a lot of sound immediately before that), so this time lets select the final one second (or so).<br><img src="AudioScreen/Audacity-FadeOutSelect.png" alt="Audacity-FadeOutSelect.png"><br>Run Effects -&gt; Fade Out.<br><img src="AudioScreen/Audacity-FadeOut.png" alt="Audacity-FadeOut.png"><br>You can listen to the end of the clip and hear that the fade out makes it much less jarring of a drop off.<br><br>Compressor?<br><br>Reverb?<br><br>Pitch (needed for exercise)<br>Tempo<br><br>Other???<br>
