<h1>Teacher Overview</h1>

<br>

This class provides an introduction to five different types of
multimedia: Photos, Graphics, Audio, Video, and Web Pages.&nbsp;
Because any of these sections could easily consume an entire course (or
several), only the basic fundamentals are covered here.&nbsp; <br>

<br>

This class was designed around a 2hr/day, 5day/wk schedule, and would
be completed in approximately five months.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a lot
of written material and screenshot-based examples here, so it is rather
flexible as to how much is actually done in class vs. outside of
class.&nbsp; <br>

<br>

Here is the layout of the class:<br>

<br>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

Introduces some fundamentals that are important to multimedia, such as
software use, computer conventions, copyright, and some basics of
design.<br>

This should take approximately 8 class hours to complete.&nbsp; <br>

<h2>Photos</h2>

Here we talk about some of the basic editing techniques (using the free
GIMP software package): How images are stored, image quality, cropping,
rotating, resizing, fixing redeye, making selections and using layers,
fixing lighting, and making minor corrections.&nbsp; Once all the
basics are complete, we quickly go over how to do the same operations
in Adobe Photoshop, so the students will be familiar with that tool as
well.<br>

This should take approximately 40 class hours to complete.<br>

<h2>Graphics</h2>

The graphics sections uses the free software tool Inkscape to teach
many of the basics of vector graphics.&nbsp; The first topic in this
section is an overview of vector graphics, and how they are different
from raster image (photos).&nbsp; Then we start learning how to create
images in Inkscape, with many of the basic tools put to use.&nbsp;
After the basics are learned in Inkscape, we will quickly walk through
the same steps in Adobe Illustrator, so the students will also be
familiar with that tool.&nbsp; To finish off the section, we use the
diagram tool Dia to create symbolic diagrams (org charts, flow charts,
etc) and see how a purpose made diagram tool such as Dia enables more
rapid diagram creation than a general purpose tool such as Inkscape.<br>

This should take approximately 40 class hours to complete.<br>

<h2>Audio</h2>

The audio section consists of four primary parts: background on audio
and formats, basic tools for audio format conversion, using the
audacity audio editor to cut, splice, interleave, channelize, filter,
and apply effects to audio samples, and finally a section about
creating podcasts and other distribution methods.<br>

This should take approximately 30 class hours to complete.<br>

<br>

<h2>Video</h2>

The video section consists of several parts, building up to complete
video editing.&nbsp; We start out by covering the fundamentals of video
and the many codec and container types.&nbsp; Then we look at some
simple format conversions using the handbrake tool.&nbsp; After that we
will do some more advanced format conversions with some pre-built
examples using the ffmpeg tool.&nbsp; In the next section we will do
some simple video editing, such as cutting clips, using the Avidemux
editor.&nbsp; Finally we will use the Kdenlive video editor to edit
full up videos, including multiple tracks of video and audio,
transitions, creating DVDs and publishing to youtube.&nbsp; As a bonus
we will give a brief overview of how to create desktop videos using the
gtk-recordmydesktop application.<br>

This should take approximately 50 class hours to complete.<br>

<br>

<h2>Web Pages</h2>

The topics covered here are even more introductory than some of the
other sections.&nbsp; First we will explore the basics of how pages are
served from web-servers and that other objects (images, sounds,
scripts) are linked to from within them.&nbsp; As part of this, we will
have an extremely brief overview of the HTML syntax specifically the
&lt;a href..., and &lt;img src... tags.&nbsp; We will then use the
Kompozer WYSIWYG html editor to create our own basic pages, and view
them from the class web-server. <br>

This should take approximately 30 class hours to complete.<br>
