<h3 class="western">File Types</h3>

<b>Photo Size</b>
<p>For a typical photograph, each of the three (Red, Green, and Blue)
channels are represented by one byte of data for each pixel. This
means that it requires three bytes of data for each pixel, this is
often referred to as 24 bit color (24 bits, because 8 bits equals 1
byte and there are three bytes). Because each byte can hold 2^8 or
256 different values, each channel can have 256 different levels of
that color (1/256 or 0.39% change per level if everything is done
evenly). You may have noticed that the R G and B values on the
demonstration we used in the channels section only had 256 different
options, if you don't remember, go back and check it out now:</p>

<p>Because there are three different channels, that means each pixel
can represent 256x256x256 colors or over 16 million different color
combinations. That's a lot more than even the largest box of
crayons. </p>

<p>For a 12 megapixel image from a modern camera, this means that it
would require 36 Megabytes (MB) of storage space! That's a lot when
you go out with your camera and want to take a bunch of pictures. If
you have a 1 Gigabyte (GB) memory card for your camera, that would
only allow you to store about 30 images. </p>

<p>Because of the huge size of files that just contain the pixels,
people have come up with various ways of compressing images into
smaller files. These can be put into two different groups: Lossless
and Lossy. </p>

<p><b>Lossless Compression </b>
</p>

<p>Lossless compression takes the files and finds ways to
mathematically make them smaller, in a way that can be completely
un-done. The easiest way to do this is to run the image through a
general compression tool like zip. Zip is a tool that is available
on all computers, that goes through any file (not just images) and
finds ways to make it smaller. One simple way this is done is if
there are many pixels in an area that are the same color, there can
be an instruction that when the image is drawn to color that whole
area in the correct color. That instruction telling what the
computer to do can be hundreds of times smaller than the amount of
space it would require to store all the pixels in the area. There
are many other ways to do this, but they are generally very
complicated and beyond the scope of this material.</p>

<p><b>Lossy Compression </b>
</p>

<p>Lossy compression is different in that once a file is compressed
there is no way to get back the exact same file, some detail is
always lost. Since images are made of millions of pixels each
possible of representing millions of different colors, there is some
room for removing detail before the human eye would notice any
difference. This can be done with a combination of the lossless
compression methods, as well as things like assuming that a color of
one pixel is similar to the pixels surrounding it, and many more
complicated methods. Also beyond the scope of this material. </p>

<p>Below are three examples which illustrate lossy compression. The
example on the left is the original and was compressed with loss-less
compression. The middle picture was compressed with lossy
compression, which was set to not loose very much data. The image on
the right used lossy compression with very aggressive settings. It
made a much smaller file size than the middle one (1.1KB vs 9.4 KB)
but obviously the compression removed parts of the image that are
important for making it look good.&nbsp; <br>

<p><b>File Storage</b></p>

<p>There are many different types of files that are used for images,
most of which support one or more specific lossless or lossy
compression methods. Below is an overview of them, there are many
less-used formats in addition that aren't listed here. See:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_file_formats">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_file_formats</a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_graphics_file_formats">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_graphics_file_formats</a>
for more information.</p>

<p><b>Bitmap</b> (.bmp, others) -- Contains all the pixels of the
image, without compression. The .bmp format specifically is used by
Microsoft in their programs for displaying images, but similar
methods are used in all types of computers. As it stores all the
pixels, this is a lossless format, in fact by default it is not
compressed at all.</p>

<p><b>JPEG</b> (.jpg, .jpeg) -- Stands for Joint Photographic
Experts Group, was developed specifically for storing images taken by
digital cameras, and is by far the most used format for digital
photographs. This is a lossy format, however with typical settings
it is very difficult to detect any image degradation.</p>

<p><b>PNG</b> (.png) -- Portable Network Graphics is better at
storing images that don't have a lot of detail, such as graphics on
websites. This is a lossless format. </p>

<p><b>GIF</b> (.gif) -- Graphics Interchange Format is similar to
but older than PNG. In general PNG should be used instead, however
there is one feature that it has that PNG currently does not, which
is to be able to have multiple images stored inside it, which can be
played back as a simple animation. </p>

<p><b>JPEG2000</b> (.jp2) -- This was an attempt at creating a
better version of the JPEG format, however it has not been very
successful, and is mostly used in professional situations such as
medical imaging. This format has options that can make it lossless
or lossy. </p>

<p><b>JPEG XR/HD Photo</b> (.jxr) -- This is another attempt at
creating a better version of the JPEG format, originally developed by
Microsoft as "HD Photo" it was submitted to the Joint
Photographic Experts Group who accepted it as a new standard. It has
not yet caught on in mainstream use. This format has options that
can make it lossless or lossy. </p>

<p><b>WebP</b> (.webp) -- This is a new format developed by Google
that is designed for replacing JPEG (and some PNG) for use in images
on the web. It is not currently supported by all web browsers, but
work is ongoing on it. This format is lossy. </p>

<p><b>TIFF</b> (.tif, .tiff) -- Tagged Image File Format is used
mostly for images of documents (such as scans). It has support for
multiple pages of images, as well as metadata such as where the image
was collected, who wrote it, etc. Usually it is used as a lossless
format, but it has the ability to use JPEG or other types of
compression inside it. </p>

<p><b>Raw</b> (.raw, .cr2, .crw, .nef, .nrw, dng, and more) -- Raw
images are not a specific format, but a grouping of many different
formats, all of which are built from cameras. By default cameras
usually produce JPEG images, which are lossy and don't contain all
the basic data that the camera recorded about the image. When a
photographer gets a raw image, he or she gets all the data that the
camera collected, which can be useful when doing advanced processing
of the images on a computer. </p>

<p><b>XCF</b> (.xcf) -- eXperimental Computing Facility is the name
of the file format used to store projects in the Gimp photo editor. It
stores photographs losslessly, and can store multiple layers of
photos and other data such as text, lines, selections and more.</p>

<p><b>PSD</b> (.psd) -- PhotoShop Document very similar to the XCF
format, but used by photoshop. It is also lossless, and can store
multiple layers of photographs and data. </p>

<p><br>
<br>
</p>

<p><big>Bonus, non raster-image formats:</big></p>

<p><b>EXIF</b> - Exchangeable Image File Format is used for metadata
about the image, it is not a file on its own, but is incorporated
into other files such as JPEG. It can contain a huge number of
different data fields including: date the image was taken, camera
settings, exposure time, aperture size, zoom level, GPS coordinates of
the camera, direction the camera was facing, and many more. </p>

<p><b>SVG</b> (.svg) -- Scalable Vector Graphics files are used to
store images generated on a computer, not photographs. These files
do not store any pixels, but rather store information about where
lines, circles, text, and other components are in relationship to
each other (referred to with vectors). It is called scalable because
the instructions for creating the image can be given any unit of
length and make the entire image based on that. In addition the
instructions for generating the image can include references to
amounts of time, so the image can change as it is drawn making an
animation. Because there are no pixels to be calculated, this is an
inherently lossless format. </p>

<p><b>EPS</b> (.eps) -- Encapsulated Post Script files are similar to
SVG files, but somewhat older and has more limited features, such as
not being able to do animation.</p>
