<h2>DVD Creation</h2><br>Even though the DVD is twenty years old, and has been largely surpassed by newer technology (BluRay, and then online video) it is still a very common format. There are many players on the market and in homes that can play a DVD.<br><br>Just like an Audio CD is a special format (not simply audio files copied onto a CD), a DVD is also a special format.&nbsp; There are a few players that will play movies that have simply been copied onto a DVD, but there are many that require it to be in the special "DVD-Video" format. This format consists of a special DVD-Video container that wraps video encoded with the MPEG2 codec.&nbsp; One or more video files may be stored on the DVD, each in its own .VOB file. The DVD-Video format also allows for things such as menus, titles, chapters, optional subtitles, optional audio tracks, and alternate video tracks.&nbsp; The .IFO (and the backup of the .IFO called the .BUP) is used to store the data (time codes, options, etc.) for all these different features.
