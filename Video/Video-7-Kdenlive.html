<h2>Kdenlive</h2>Unlike Handbrake or Avidemux, Kdenlive is a full-featured editor suitable for much more than making clips of video or converting other videos. This has support for bringing together dozens of clips of video (in different formats), multiple tracks of audio and video displaying together and transitioning from one to the other, and rendering finished video in to many different formats.&nbsp; Throughout this section we will be doing all these things, and when you're done you'll be all set to create your own full-featured videos!<br><br><h3>Getting Started</h3>When you first open Kdenlive (if someone in that user profile hasn't done it before you) you will be prompted for a folder where your project's files will reside. It is important to pick a good folder here, because when you actually go to save the project, this folder won't change, all that specifies is where you save the .kdenlive project file all the other data still is stored here.&nbsp; But don't worry if you didn't pick a good one the first time or need to change it. If you want to change the default location, that can be done in Settings -&gt; Configure Kdenlive... -&gt; Environment -&gt; Default Folders in the Project Folder box. <br>However, if you have already started a project, you can change the location of the Folder containing it in Project -&gt; Project Settings in the Project Folder box. Also in the Project Settings dialogue, we can select the format we want our final video to be in, in this case lets choose VGA Widescreen NTSC.&nbsp; This will give us 854x480 (16:9) resolution, 30000/1001 (or 29.97) frames per second, progressive video.<br><br>Also, before we start the editing, lets create and save our project file. Since we've already got our project in the folder we want, we can probably just name the project something descriptive and save it there. In the future we could have other projects that we save here also, which could share resources (videos, images, audio, etc) with this project, saving space.<br><br>Ok, with that out of the way, lets get started! The first thing you'll want to do is import some clips.&nbsp; You can get the ones we'll be using for this project here:<br>Intro.mkv<br>BunnyPrep.mkv<br>RedSquirrel.mkv<br>GraySquirrel.mkv<br>FlyingSquirrel.mkv<br>BigBuckBunny-stereo.flac<br>freestylemix_-_hisboyelroy_-_Revolve.mp3<br><br>Download all of those to your hard disk.&nbsp; Then in Kdenlive with the "Project Tree" visible, click the button just above to Add Clip.&nbsp; Use this dialog to select each of the files.<br><img style="width: 429px; height: 248px;" src="Screen/Kdenlive-LoadClips.png" alt="Kdenlive-LoadClips.png"><br><br><img src="Screen/Kdenlive-ClipsReady.png" alt="Kdenlive-ClipsReady.png"><br><br>We can create folders within our project to organize all our clips. Just right click inside the project tree and select Create Folder. Lets make three and name them Videos, Audio, and Text.&nbsp; Go ahead and drag the clips into the appropriate folder.<br><img src="Screen/Kdenlive-Folders.png" alt="Kdenlive-Folders.png"><br><br>Now we're all set to create our first video. First drag the Intro clip down into the Video 1 track at the bottom. Then put the BunnyPrep clip immediately after it in the same track.<br><img style="width: 1056px; height: 796px;" src="Screen/Kdenlive-TwoClips.png" alt="Kdenlive-TwoClips.png"><br><br>Now that we've got our first cut of a video, we can watch it in the Project Monitor. Just click the play button.<br><img style="width: 1048px; height: 794px;" src="Screen/Kdenlive-ProjectMonitor.png" alt="Kdenlive-ProjectMonitor.png"><br>Notice the line (just like in Audacity) that follows the video across the timeline.<br><br>Once we've checked out our video and everything looks good, we need to "render" it to a file. I'll talk more about what rendering means later, but for now just know that it takes what you saw in the project monitor and outputs it to a file format of your choice.&nbsp; Click the Render button to get started.<br><img src="Screen/Kdenlive-BasicRender.png" alt="Kdenlive-BasicRender.png"><br>In the render dialogue, we're going to select a type of "File rendering" from the drop-down box. We'll pick a name for our file. I input "BasicClip.mp4".&nbsp; Then select MPEG-4 from the list of encoding types, and we'll use the 6000k (only a single pass for now, to speed things up).&nbsp; When you're all set, hit the "Render to File" button.<br><img src="Screen/Kdenlive-Rendering.png" alt="Kdenlive-Rendering.png"><br>Once the file is done rendering, you can go out to the directory you saved it in, and open it in a video player to see how it looks.<br><br>Picking Clips<br><br><br><br>Use Big Buck Bunny<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take the three clips of the squirrles (from longest
to shortest) and have them composited in to a screen with text saying
"The Villans". One below, two above. Show the left-right centering, and
for the top two how to manually adjust the left-right and up-down
spacing. <br>
