<h2>Cutting with Avidemux</h2>Avidemux is a very simple video editor and converter.&nbsp; Unlike handbrake or ffmpeg, it has only limited support for multiple channels of audio/video/subtitles.&nbsp; Also, its codec support is more limited than ffmpeg's (but it has more than handbrake).&nbsp; Additionally, it was originally written to work with files in the Microsoft Windows AVI format, because of this other formats/codecs do not work properly in special circumstances.&nbsp; <br><br>Even though this is a simple tool, with some annoying errors, it is very useful for times when you have a clip of video and want to either remove a section from it, or take only a section of it and save it as a seperate file.&nbsp; Starting with our <a href="Clips/SintelTrailer/sintel_clip-408p-mpeg4-mp3.mp4">clip from sintel</a>, we're going to try out both of these simple operations.<br><br>Lets start by opening the clip in the Avidemux program:<br><img src="Screen/Avidemux-Open.png" alt="Avidemux-Open.png"><br>

<h3>Cutting a Clip<br></h3>Next we'll set the encoding paramaters from the drop-down menus on the left.&nbsp; We'll just MPEG-4 ASV (avcodec), MP3 (lame), and MP4.&nbsp; Whenever we click the save button, it will save our current selection (after asking us for a file name) by encoding the selection to this format.&nbsp; This can be a time-consuming process for large files, so it is possible to just set it to "copy", in which case it won't re-encode the video, however this can sometimes lead to errors.<br><img src="Screen/Avidemux-Encoding.png" alt="Avidemux-Encoding.png"><br><br><br>For our first example, we want to make the movie a bit shorter, by cutting out the black area around the introduction title.&nbsp; We'll use the "Next Keyframe" button to advance the video until we can see the title:<br><img src="Screen/Avidemux-ForwardKeyframe.png" alt="Avidemux-ForwardKeyframe.png"><br><br>But we want to start cutting *before* we see the title, so we'll go backwards one keyframe:<br><img src="Screen/Avidemux-BackKeyframe.png" alt="Avidemux-BackKeyframe.png"><br>This will leave us on an entirely black screen.&nbsp; If we go back any further we will start to see the outline of the previous scene.<br><br>Now we will select this as the starting point of our selection:<br><img src="Screen/Avidemux-SelStart.png" alt="Avidemux-SelStart.png"><br>Once we have the starting point, we can use the "next keyframe" button to advance to where we're not seeing black anymore, and again back-up so we have only the black screen.<br><br>Now we want to mark the end of our selection:<br><img src="Screen/Avidemux-SelEnd.png" alt="Avidemux-SelEnd.png"><br><br>Finally, we're ready to cut the unwanted part out of the video:<br><img src="Screen/Avidemux-Cut.png" alt="Avidemux-Cut.png"><br><br>Now we want to save our video, without the black section.&nbsp; We can't simply click the save button now, because that only will save our selection, and since we just removed the selection from the video, there is currently no selection to save!&nbsp; We want to make a selection of the entire video.&nbsp; It easy, just go to the start of the clip:<br><img src="Screen/Avidemux-Start.png" alt="Avidemux-Start.png"><br>Once there, hit the button to mark the start of the selection.<br><br>Now we want to go to the end of the clip:<br><img src="Screen/Avidemux-End.png" alt="Avidemux-End.png"><br>And we'll hit the button for the end of the selection.&nbsp; This will give us a selection of the whole clip.<br><br>Now we can hit the save button, and specify the file that where we want to put the output.<br><img src="Screen/Avidemux-SaveFull.png" alt="Avidemux-SaveFull.png"><br>That's all!<br><br><h3>Saving a Single Segment</h3>For our next exercise, we'll go and pick out just the video containing the old man and save that segment to a file.&nbsp; <br><br>Just like last time, we can use the "Next Keyframe" and "Previous Keyframe" buttons to find where it starts.&nbsp; Then mark that as the start of our selection.&nbsp; Then we can advanced to just past where he finishes.&nbsp; In this case the keyframe immediately after where he is present in the video doesn't contain him, but the girl.&nbsp; Instead of going back a keyframe, and then having to move forward in the video, we can just go to the keyframe with the girl, then go back just one frame:<br><img src="Screen/Avidemux-BackFrame.png" alt="Avidemux-BackFrame.png"><br>At this point we have the final frame on the screen and we can go ahead and hit the button to make this the end of our selection.<br><br>Now that we have a selection of just the video that we want, we can hit the save button and select the filename we want to save the section as.<br><img src="Screen/Avidemux-SaveSelection.png" alt="Avidemux-SaveSelection.png"><br><br>
