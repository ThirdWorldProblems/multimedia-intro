<h2>Cutting with Avidemux</h2>Avidemux is a very simple video editor and converter.&nbsp; Unlike handbrake or ffmpeg, it has only limited support for multiple channels of audio/video/subtitles.&nbsp; Also, its codec support is more limited than ffmpeg's (but it has more than handbrake).&nbsp; Additionally, it was originally written to work with files in the Microsoft Windows AVI format, because of this other formats/codecs do not work properly in special circumstances.&nbsp; <br><br>Even though this is a simple tool, with some annoying errors, it is very useful for times when you have a clip of video and want to either remove a section from it, or take only a section of it and save it as a seperate file.&nbsp; Starting with our clip from sintel, we're going to try out both of these simple operations.<br><br><br><br>
