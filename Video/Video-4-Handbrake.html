<h2>Handbrake&nbsp;</h2>Handbrake is a video transcoder that can take in video of one format (typical computer video, but also DVD or BluRay format) and output a video in one of several popular formats.<br><br>To show the conversion in action, we are going to open <a href="http://jp2-s1/vid_test/sintel_clip_x264-lossless-flac.mkv">this</a> (Institute Only) lossless segment of the sintel trailer, and use Handbrake to make a compressed version of it.<br><br>Lets start up Handbrake.<br><img src="Screen/Handbrake.png" alt="Handbrake.png"><br>Click the Source button and load the video we want to convert.<br><br>Once the video is loaded, you will see a lot of the information on the screen populated.<br><img src="Screen/Handbrake-Loaded.png" alt="Handbrake-Loaded.png"><br>The "Source:" section contains information about our video.&nbsp; In this case, it says it is 10 seconds long, and there is only one chapter and angle.&nbsp; For videos coming off of a DVD or BluRay this may have multiple chapters and/or angles.<br><br>The "Destination" has the file we will write the output to.&nbsp; The only two options are MP4 (MPEG 4) or MKV (Matroska).&nbsp; For MP4, it is possible to check the "Web optimized" box.&nbsp; This puts information about the video in the front of the file, so if you put it on a web-page it can start playing before the entire video has been downloaded.<br><br>On the summary tab, there is information about the input video, specifically dimensions (which give the aspect ratio) and the frame rate.&nbsp; <br><br>Going to the video tab gives us options for compressing the video. <br><br><br>
