<h2>Handbrake&nbsp;</h2>

Handbrake is a video transcoder that can take in video of one format
(typical computer video, but also DVD or BluRay format) and output a
video in one of several popular formats.<br>

<br>

To show the conversion in action, we are going to open <a href="Clips/SintelTrailer/sintel_clip_x264-lossless-flac.mkv">this</a> lossless segment of the sintel trailer, and use
Handbrake to make a compressed version of it.<br>

<br>

Lets start up Handbrake.<br>

<img src="Screen/Handbrake.png" alt="Handbrake.png"><br>

Click the Source button and load the video we want to convert.<br>

<br>

Once the video is loaded, you will see a lot of the information on the
screen populated.<br>

The "Source:" section contains information about our video.&nbsp; In
this case, it says it is 10 seconds long, and there is only one chapter
and angle.&nbsp; For videos coming off of a DVD or BluRay this may have
multiple chapters and/or angles.<br>

<br>

The "Destination" has the file we will write the output to.&nbsp; The
only two options are MP4 (MPEG 4) or MKV (Matroska).&nbsp; For MP4, it
is possible to check the "Web optimized" box.&nbsp; This puts
information about the video in the front of the file, so if you put it
on a web-page it can start playing before the entire video has been
downloaded.<br>

<br>

On the summary tab, there is information about the input video,
specifically dimensions (which give the aspect ratio) and the frame
rate.&nbsp; <br>

<br>

Going to the video tab gives us options for compressing the video. <br>

The video codec options that are available are: H.264, MPEG 4 (Part 2),
and Theora (not availble with MP4).&nbsp; To the right, there are
options for specifying how the encoder should determine the size of the
file.&nbsp; You can set the average bit-rate that you desire, or you
can set the size of the final file you would like and the encoder will
figure out what bit-rate it can use.&nbsp; When either of these options
are set, you can enable 2-Pass encoding with the check-box on the left.
There is also a third option which is to set the quality of the final
video.&nbsp; Smaller numbers mean higher quality and higher file size,
lower numbers are lower quality and file size.&nbsp; <br>

<br>

On the Audio tab are the options for encoding each track of
audio.&nbsp; Handbrake will allow you to put multiple tracks of audio
into one file (multiple languages, a track with the director's
comentary, etc) that the viewer can then select while they are watching
the video.&nbsp; For each track of audio, a codec (AAC, MP3, Vorbis
(only available in MKV format), or AC3) can be selected along with a
bit-rate.&nbsp; <br>

<br>

The subtitles page is similar to the audio page, in that you can have
several subtitle tracks built in to the single video file.&nbsp; You
can use any subtitles from the source, or add external ones from a .srt
file.&nbsp; <br>

<br>

By clicking the Picture Settings button at the top of the application,
it is possible to change the dimensions of the video, by cropping or
stretching the video.&nbsp; <br>

<br>

<img src="Screen/Handbrake-Filters.png" alt="Handbrake-Filters.png"><br>

Finally, by going to the filters tab of the pictures settings, it is
possible to apply some simple filters.&nbsp; The most important of
which would be "Deinterlace" which will fix interlaced video for use on
a computer screen.&nbsp; <br>

<br>

Once you have all the settings correct, hit the Start button at the
top, and the encoding will start.&nbsp; You will see the status of the
encoding along the bottom.<br>
