<h1 class="western">Unit Four -- Video </h1>

Video, especiall digital video, is becoming increasingly more
ubiquitous in our lives.&nbsp; Television, both the older analog form
and new digital/HD TV, are hugely popular.&nbsp; There are an enormous
number of movies coming out ever year.&nbsp; And over the last few
years, video has started to explode onto the web, led by sites like
YouTube, Vimeo, Metacafe, and many more.&nbsp; While it is very
difficult to get into the Televison or Movie industries, anyone can
quickly and easily upload a video to one of those websites and, if the
content and quality are good, get thousands or even millions of people
to see their video.&nbsp; This has opened up huge new opportunities for
sharing with family and friends, marketing to an audience, and even
creating a new show or film.&nbsp; <br>

<br>

In this unit we will talk about how video works as well as how to
convert, trim, edit, and create it.&nbsp; We will focus on digital
video, that could be easily uploaded to one of the online sites, but
what we will learn could also easily apply to the television or movie
industries.&nbsp; <br>

<h2>Vocabulary</h2>
Frame - One image of a video. Many of these are shown every second so that video looks like it is moving.<br>

Frame Rate - The number of frames of video shown each second.<br>




Aspect Ratio - The ratio of the width of the image to the height of the
image.&nbsp; For modern video this is 16:9 or 17:9, for older video this is usually 4:3 (the same as photographs).<br>

Interlacing - When only half the lines of video are shown each frame.
This was done in older formats to lower then bandwidth needed but in
modern video degrades the quality.<br>

Pixel Format - Unlike photographs where every pixel has one byte for
each of R,G,B; video usually uses more complicated, but smaller ways of
storing pixels.<br>

YUV - The type of pixel representation that is most often used in
video. The Y value is the luminance (or brightness), the U and V values
provide the color makeup.<br>

Container - This is the name for how the frames of video, audio, subtitles and other items are packed into a digital file. <br>

Codec - Short for enCOder/DECoder. The codec is the mechanism that is
used to compress the video to a smaller size and to turn it back into
video when it is being watched.<br>

Interframe Compression - When a Codec looks at future and past frames
of video to determine how to encode/decode the current frame of video.
This enables the codec to do a much better job at compressing areas of
the frame that haven't changed much since the last frame of video.<br>



Bit Rate - The number of bits per second that are used to store the audio or video as digital data.<br>


Two Pass Encoding - In this type of encoding, the encoder runs through
the whole video a first time, to determine what areas are easier or
harder to encode. Then when it goes through a second time, it can use
more bits to encode the difficult parts and less for the easy parts.
This is a type of Variable Bit Rate (VBR) encoding.<br>

Transition - A way of joining two parts of video together smoothly.<br>

Jump Transition - The most common type of transition, where one clip simply ends and the next one starts immediately.<br>

Dissolve Transition - When one clip ends and slowly blends into the next clip.<br>

Wipe Transition - When the video from one clip wipes the video from the
previous clip off the screen, using some sort of pattern (line, star,
circle, etc). This type of transition should be avoided.<br>

Composite - Having two or more clips of video playing at the same time in a video.<br>

Green Screen - Also known as Blue Screen or Chroma Key, filming with
this enables the editor to remove the background (since it is all the
same color) and put in a different background.<br>
