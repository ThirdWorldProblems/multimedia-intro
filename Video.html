<h3 class="western">Codec and Container Overview</h3>
<p>Codecs</p>MJPEG - Uses the JPEG format for fotographs to compress every frame of video.&nbsp; This results in a very low compression ratio (large files), but is realitively easy to do.&nbsp; Many digital cameras that also capture video use this to encode their video.<br>MPEG 2 (aka H.262) - This is the successor to the Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG) first video standard, MPEG 1.&nbsp; When DVDs were first created, this was one of the most advanced codecs, and was selected for use as the only codec universally supported for DVDs.&nbsp; Since then newer and better codecs have been created but the DVD standard is not able to be changed, so DVDs still use this.<br>VP2 (aka Theora) - This is an older codec but is significant in that it was the first video codec to be released under an open source license, and was named Theora.&nbsp; This codec is free to implement for anyone in software or hardware.&nbsp; However, as it is older the performance of the codec doesn't match some of the modern equilivants.&nbsp; Theora's performance is substantially better than MPEG 2, but a touch worse than most MPEG 4 Part 2 implementations.<br>
H.263 (aka Flash4) - This is the most widely <br>MPEG 4 Part 2 (aka DivX, XVID, MS MPEG4v3) - <br>MPEG 4 Part 10 (aka MPEG 4 - AVC, H.264) - <br>VP8 - <br>VC-1 (aka WMV3) - <br>Dirac (aka VC-2) - <br><p>Containers</p><p>MPEG-TS<br>MPEG-PS<br>AVI<br>MOV<br>WMV (aka ASF)<br>FLV<br>Ogg<br>
