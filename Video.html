<h1 class="western">Unit Four -- Video </h1>

Video, especially digital video, is becoming increasingly more
ubiquitous in our lives.&nbsp; Television, both the older analog form
and new digital/HD TV, are hugely popular.&nbsp; There are an enormous
number of movies coming out ever year.&nbsp; And over the last few
years, video has started to explode onto the web, led by sites like
YouTube, Vimeo, Metacafe, and many more.&nbsp; While it is very
difficult to get into the Televison or Movie industries, anyone can
quickly and easily upload a video to one of those websites and, if the
content and quality are good, get thousands or even millions of people
to see their video.&nbsp; This has opened up huge new opportunities for
sharing with family and friends, marketing to an audience, and even
creating a new show or film.&nbsp; <br>

<br>

In this unit we will talk about how video works as well as how to
convert, trim, edit, and create it.&nbsp; We will focus on digital
video, that could be easily uploaded to one of the online sites, but
what we will learn could also easily apply to the television or movie
industries.&nbsp; <br>

<h2>Vocabulary</h2>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Frame</span> - One image of a video. Many of these are shown every second so
that video looks like it is moving.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">

Frame Rate</span> - The number of frames of video shown each second.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">

Aspect Ratio</span> - The ratio of the width of the image to the height of the
image.&nbsp; For modern video this is 16:9 or 17:9, for older video
this is usually 4:3 (the same as photographs).<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">

Interlacing</span> - When only half the lines of video are shown each frame.
This was done in older formats to lower then bandwidth needed but in
modern video degrades the quality.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">

Pixel Format</span> - Unlike photographs where every pixel has one byte for
each of R,G,B; video usually uses more complicated, but smaller ways of
storing pixels.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">

YUV</span> - The type of pixel representation that is most often used in
video. The Y value is the luminance (or brightness), the U and V values
provide the color makeup.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">

Container</span> - This is the name for how the frames of video, audio,
subtitles and other items are packed into a digital file. <br><span style="font-weight: bold;">

Codec</span> - Short for enCOder/DECoder. The codec is the mechanism that is
used to compress the video to a smaller size and to turn it back into
video when it is being watched.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">

Interframe Compression</span> - When a Codec looks at future and past frames
of video to determine how to encode/decode the current frame of video.
This enables the codec to do a much better job at compressing areas of
the frame that haven't changed much since the last frame of video.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">

Bit Rate</span> - The number of bits per second that are used to store the
audio or video as digital data.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">

Two Pass Encoding</span> - In this type of encoding, the encoder runs through
the whole video a first time, to determine what areas are easier or
harder to encode. Then when it goes through a second time, it can use
more bits to encode the difficult parts and less for the easy parts.
This is a type of Variable Bit Rate (VBR) encoding.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Transition</span> - A way of joining two parts of video together smoothly.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">

Jump Transition</span> - The most common type of transition, where one clip
simply ends and the next one starts immediately.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">

Dissolve Transition</span> - When one clip ends and slowly blends into the
next clip.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">

Wipe Transition</span> - When the video from one clip wipes the video from the
previous clip off the screen, using some sort of pattern (line, star,
circle, etc). This type of transition should be avoided.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">

Composite</span> - Having two or more clips of video playing at the same time
in a video.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">

Green Screen</span> - Also known as Blue Screen or Chroma Key, filming with
this enables the editor to remove the background (since it is all the
same color) and put in a different background.<br>

Do not submit the final video, rather, copy and past the output from
the two following commands:<br>

ls -l NameOfYourFile<br>

ffmpeg -i NameOfYourFile<br>

<h2>Avidemux Activity</h2>

Use Avidemux to save (using MPEG4 ASP and MP3 codecs) only the section

video</a> where the dragon is flying around the tower and grabs the
smaller dragon. <br>

<br>

Submit the clip of video that you saved.<br>

<h2>Kdenlive Activity</h2>
