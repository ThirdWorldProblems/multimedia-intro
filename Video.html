<h1 class="western">Unit Four -- Video </h1>

Video, especiall digital video, is becoming increasingly more
ubuitiquous in our lives.&nbsp; Television, both the older analog form
and new digital/HD TV, are hugely popular.&nbsp; There are an enormous
number of movies coming out ever year.&nbsp; And over the last few
years, video has started to explode onto the web, led by sites like
YouTube, Vimeo, Metacafe, and many more.&nbsp; While it is very
difficult to get into the Televison or Movie industries, anyone can
quickly and easily upload a video to one of those websites and, if the
content and quality are good, get thousands or even millions of people
to see their video.&nbsp; This has opened up huge new oppertunities for
sharing with family and friends, marketing to an audience, and even
creating a new show or film.&nbsp; <br>

<br>

In this unit we will talk about how video works as well as how to
convert, trim, edit, and create it.&nbsp; We will focus on digital
video, that could be easily uploaded to one of the online sites, but
what we will learn could also easily apply to the television or movie
industries.&nbsp; <br><br><br>
