<h3 class="western">Rotation, Cropping, Re-sizing<br>
</h3>

Rotating, cropping, and re-sizing are three of the most basic, and
easiest ways you can transform an image to make it match what you need
from it.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">For the activities in this section, we
will work with the image you can get from <a href="PhotoExamples/PhotoCrop-Ex-orig.jpg">this link here</a>, right
click on the link and save it to your disk.&nbsp; <br>
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rotation</span><br>
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">When working with photographs, you will
often come across ones where the photographer wasn't holding the camera
perfectly level while they took the image.&nbsp; This is easy to
correct in the GIMP by rotating the image back in to level.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Once we have the image open, we will select the rotate tool from the
toolbox.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><img src="PhotoScreen/RotateSelect.jpg" alt="RotateSelect.jpg"></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Once you are in the rotate tool, simply
click on the picture and while you are still holding down the mouse
button, move the mouse.&nbsp; This will spin the image around, just
spin it to an orientation that looks correct.&nbsp; The post that the
subject is leaning against should be vertical and the light/shadow line
just under her should be horizontal, but it doesn't have to be exact,
just close enough to look good.&nbsp; If it helps, you can use the zoom
button at the bottom of the image window to zoom in closer on the
subject.<br>
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><img src="PhotoScreen/RotateInProgress.jpg" alt="RotateInProgress.jpg"></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">When you are done moving it, and you
like how it looks, click the Rotate button. The GIMP will process the
image for a moment, and then you will have your new, rotated
image!&nbsp; (You can save now to make sure you don't loose your work)<br>
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><img src="PhotoScreen/RotationComplete.jpg" alt="RotationComplete.jpg"></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">But now we have a bit of a
problem!&nbsp; The image has gray checkered borders!&nbsp; (This gray
checkered pattern is what the GIMP displays when there is nothing
there, it means that those pixels of the image are completely
blank.)&nbsp; Since we took a rectangular image and rotated it while
continuing to display it in a rectangular area, we had gaps appear (and
other areas disappeared).&nbsp; This usually isn't a big problem, if
you are otherwise happy with the image, you can just use the cropping
tool to cut the image down a little bit.&nbsp; However, we're not happy
with the image yet, so we're going to do some other things first...</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cropping</span><br>
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">First, the word.&nbsp; In general the
word to "crop" is used in all kinds of publishing, art, graphic design,
photography, etc., it just means to cut the edges off of
something.&nbsp; <br>
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">There are two main reasons to crop a
photo.&nbsp; The first is the subject only takes up a small area of the
photo.&nbsp; In this case, you can crop the photo down so that the
subject is the majority of what is being shown.&nbsp; The second
important reason to crop an image is to improve the spacing between
various elements in the image.&nbsp; This is a little more complicated
than the first reason.&nbsp; Most amateurs who take photos
incorrectly believe that the picture will look the best when the
subject of the image is directly in the center.&nbsp; However, over the
years artists have figured out that this isn't correct.&nbsp; It is
more pleasing to the human eye when subjects are 1/3 or 2/3 of the way
across or down an image.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Think of your image in terms of a grid. The ideal locations for a
subject are at the intersections of the lines, represented on this
diagram by gray dots.&nbsp; If that isn't possible, or feasible, then
you can try to line up large features under the vertical and horizontal
lines. <br>
</p>

<img style="width: 310px; height: 231px;" src="PhotoExamples/ThirdsGrid.png" alt="ThirdsGrid.png"><br>

It can often be tricky to figure out what are the subjects, or fit all
the important features in a photo and still use the rule of
thirds.&nbsp;
Don't worry!&nbsp; This isn't an exact science, its just a good rule of
thumb to keep in mind. <br>

<br>

For an example, there are two images below.&nbsp; The one on the left
has the large rock outcrop centered in the middle of the image.&nbsp;
The one on the right uses the rule of thirds to put the rock outcrop
1/3 of the way over from the left side.&nbsp; Additionally, the horizon
(where the rocks meet the sky) is 1/3 of the way up from the top and
the parallel clouds take up the top 1/3 of the image.&nbsp; <br>

<img style="width: 100%;" src="PhotoExamples/ThirdsSideBySideAnimation.gif" alt="ThirdsSideBySideAnimation.gif">
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">You may notice that the one on the right
feels somewhat more open, and less crowded.&nbsp; It is generally
better to not have crowded photos.&nbsp; Additionally, notice that to
get this less crowded feeling, the size of the features didn't have to
be changed.&nbsp; The rock and the background are the same size in both
images.&nbsp; <br>
</p>

<br>

Let's continue with the image we were working on before.&nbsp; To crop,
we will select the crop tool from the toolbox:<br>

<img src="PhotoScreen/CropTool.jpg" alt="CropTool.jpg"><br>

<br>

We can go ahead and crop the picture down so that just the interesting
stuff in the center around the subject is visible.&nbsp; Move the mouse
to
the upper-left corner of the area you want to be visible.&nbsp; Then
click
the mouse button, and while you are holding it down, move the mouse to
the lower-right corner of the area you want.&nbsp; The GIMP darkens the
area that will be cut-off, so that the clear area will be what remains
after the crop.&nbsp; When you are happy with the area, let go of the
mouse button. <br>

<br>

<img src="PhotoScreen/CropSimple.jpg" alt="CropSimple.jpg"><br>

If you then decide you want to change the area some how, you can hover
your mouse button over the area near the edges.&nbsp; It will pop up a
box indicating that you are going to change that edge (works with
corners also, then two edges will move). In the above example, I have
the box up for the right edge of the crop area.&nbsp; To move this
edge, just hold down the mouse button and move it until you are happy
with the new area.&nbsp; When you are done click the mouse button once
somewhere inside the clear area to complete the crop.&nbsp; <br>

<br>

But hang on, as was discussed previously, 4:3 is generally a good ratio
for photographs, so it would be nice if the image we had when we were
done
was still 4:3.&nbsp; Luckily the GIMP crop tool has an option that can
be set for just this purpose.&nbsp; We do this in the "Tool Options"
dialog below the toolbox.&nbsp; You may have noticed that when we
selected the crop tool, this dialog automatically changed to the
options for the crop tool.&nbsp; This will happen whenever you select a
new tool, so that the options displayed here always match the tool you
are working with.<br>

We're going to go ahead and check the box in front of "Fixed:" and
select the "Aspect Ratio" option from the box.&nbsp; Then in the text
field just below that line, we will put in the ratio of 4:3.&nbsp; <br>

<br>

<img src="PhotoScreen/CropAspect.jpg" alt="CropAspect.jpg"><br>

<br>

Now, try cropping the image again, to get back to the image one step
before hit the buttons "Ctrl" + "z" one time to undo your previous
crop.&nbsp; (You can also do this in the menu Edit-&gt;Undo Crop Image)
You notice that when you move your mouse to select the area that will
be kept, the box is a bit more rigid.&nbsp; With the fixed aspect
ratio, it is not possible to increase one of the sides without
increasing one of the adjacent ones.&nbsp; <br>

<br>

Alas, we're not quite done...we haven't used our rule-of-thirds yet on
the area that we're going to crop.&nbsp; Again, The GIMP is there to
help us with this.&nbsp; The crop tool has an option for displaying a
"Guide" that puts lines for the rule of thirds up in your window as you
select your area.&nbsp; To activate it simply select "Rule of thirds"
from the guides selection drop-down in the Crop tool box.&nbsp; (It
probably currently says "No guides" in your tool options)<br>

<img src="PhotoScreen/CropThirdsGuide.jpg" alt="CropThirdsGuide.jpg"><br>

<br>

Alright, now we're set for our final try at cropping.&nbsp; If you
currently have an already cropped image on your screen, hit Ctrl+Z
until you get back to the image you had after you rotated it.&nbsp; Now
select an area that has the subject occupying a large part of the area,
is in 4:3 ratio, and uses the rule of thirds and crop it!<br>

<img src="PhotoScreen/CropFinal.jpg" alt="CropFinal.jpg"><br>

<br>

And now we get our final, cropped image:<br>

<img src="PhotoExamples/PhotoCrop-Ex-cropped.jpg" alt="PhotoCrop-Ex-cropped.jpg"><br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Re-Sizing</span><br>

You may have noticed that the image that we just finished with took up
most of your browser window, even after we cropped off a huge part of
it.&nbsp; Since digital cameras these days are capable of taking such
large, high-resolution pictures, this is a fairly common problem when
pictures are used on the web.&nbsp; It is possible to have the site
tell the web browser to shrink the picture and not display it at full
size, but then you still have to transfer the whole picture.&nbsp;
Because the picture is so big, it has to store all those pixels, and
the file size is also big.&nbsp; The above image is 131KB, which isn't
huge, but it can make the site slow to load, especially if you have
lots of pictures like that.&nbsp; Instead, what should be done, is the
image should be re-sized down to be the correct size for
displaying.&nbsp; Changing the size in this manner will not change what
it looks like on the web site (if displayed at the same
resolution).&nbsp; This is different from using the quality selector
when saving the image, as that does change how the image looks (just
hopefully not so the eye can make it out).&nbsp; <br>

<br>

A quick note, there is almost never a good reason to re-size a picture
to something larger.&nbsp; When you make it smaller, the program doing
the shrinking can easily take out pixels to make it the correct
size.&nbsp; However, if you were to try to make it larger, it doesn't
know what the pixels in between the current pixels should be to add
in.&nbsp; So what it does is it just guesses, based on what pixels are
around it.&nbsp; This will indeed make it larger, but will also
increase the file size of the image.&nbsp; If you want a larger image
on your web site, that is when it is better for the site to tell the
web browser how big the image should be.&nbsp; <br>

<br>

Re-sizing in the GIMP is easy.&nbsp; Just go to Image -&gt; Scale
Image.&nbsp; You will see the Scale Image dialog on the screen.&nbsp;
Now you can input the size you want for an image.&nbsp; <br>

If you have a web site, you may already know exactly how many pixels
you
want the image to be.&nbsp; To do this, you can select "pixels" in the
first drop down box, then put the number of pixels you want for the
width or height.&nbsp; You only have to put one of the values in, and
the GIMP will automatically calculate the other.&nbsp; It is possible
to change them independently (by clicking the little chain between them
to un-link them), but this should almost never be done because it will
cause the image to distort and make it look stretched out.&nbsp; <br>

If you don't already know the exact dimensions you need your image to
be, it is generally easier to re-size it to a percentage of the
original.&nbsp; To do this select "percent" from the first drop down
box, then enter your best get at what percent of the original you want
your new image to be.&nbsp; <br>

<br>

<img src="PhotoScreen/Scale.jpg" alt="Scale.jpg"><br>

<br>

If you're happy with your image, you can go ahead and save it.&nbsp; If
you're trying to make it small for a web site, don't forget to adjust
the quality selector to make it as small as you can.&nbsp; <br>

<br>

After all that rotating, cropping, and re-sizing, here's the final
image.&nbsp; Its only 24KB, when we started with a 3900KB original!<br>
