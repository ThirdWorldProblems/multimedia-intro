<h2 class="western">Vector Graphics</h2>
<p>Unlike raster images (photos, covered in Unit One) vector graphics
do not consist of pixels arranged on a grid with different values.
Instead vector graphics are stored as sets of instructions that a
computer can run to re-create a graphic. </p>
<p>A simplistic example of these instructions could be:</p>
<ol><li>
    <p>Create a circle with a center 3 units above the center, and a
radius of 2 units. </p>
  </li><li>
    <p>Fill circle with yellow</p>
  </li><li>
    <p>Create a line from 2 units below the center to 3 units above and
two units left of the center.</p>
  </li><li>
    <p>Create a line from 2 units below the center to 3 units above and
two units right of the center.</p>
  </li></ol>
<p>If there were a program that could run this very simple script, it
might draw to the screen the following:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="VectorGraphics/SimpleScriptOutput.png" alt="SimpleScriptOutput.png"></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The good thing about this is that you'll most likely never have to
actually look at the script the computer creates, just like you never
have to look at the array of pixels and channels that are stored in a
photograph. However, if you want to get advanced, that would be
possible (and quite a bit easier than editing a raster image). Instead,
we will be using tools that convert the things we draw with
the mouse and keyboard into one of these scripts that the computer
can follow when it wants to re-produce an image to view on the screen
(the screen is really just a raster graphic viewer). Then when we
are all done, we can have it run the script again to produce another
raster graphic that can be saved into a PNG file. </p>
<p>It is also possible for this script to include a certain amount of
time to wait before something happens. This allows for animations
some simple examples would be having a stick figure move across the
image or having a ball bounce.</p>Scale to any size.<br><p></p><br><h3 class="western">File Formats</h3>
<p>The primary file format currently in use is SVG or Scalable Vector
Graphics (see: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svg">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svg</a>
) which is a type of human readable file called XML. Although XML
and SVG are human-readable, we will not be reading them directly as
part of this material. SVG is supported in most vector drawing
programs, however it is not yet supported by all web browsers (though
this is rapidly changing). If you simply want to use your images on
web pages, it is best to convert them to Portable Network Graphics
(PNG) which is a lossless raster format. </p>
<p>The other major format for Vector Graphics is the EPS or
Encapsulated Post Script. Post Script itself is a file type used for
printing (especially industrial printing), and EPS images are built
to be easily put inside of a Post Script document. This format has
been around a lot longer than SVG, and is supported by many more
tools (especially the old ones). Likewise, it is not recommended for
use with web browsers.</p><h2 class="western">Inkscape</h2>Inkscape will be the vector editor that we do the majority of our work in, once we have learned the fundamentals here, we will move on to trying the same concepts out in Adobe Illustrator, which is the other major vector graphics editor on the market.&nbsp; <br><br>To start with Inkscape, there are three interactive tutorials that are built in to the program that are very good, and because they are interactive, they are better than just words on paper, so instead of reading what they have to tell you here, lets open up inkscape and give them a try.&nbsp; <br><img src="VectorScreen/InkscapeStartup.png" alt="InkscapeStartup.png"><br>Once you have Inkscape open...<br><br>Go to the menu Help -&gt; Tutorials -&gt; Inkscape: Basics.&nbsp; That will open in a new window and you can read all about (and try out!) panning, zooming, the tools, documents, moving, scaling, rotating, important keys, selections, fills, strokes, duplication, layers, and depth.<br><br>Once you've masterd those basics, we'll move on to the next tutorial:<br>Help -&gt; Tutorials -&gt; Inkscape: Shapes<br>Here we will learn about and try out: <br>Rectangles (with rounding), ellipses and circles, stars and polygons, and spirals.<br><br>Finally, we have one last tutorial that introduces some of the most important concepts:<br>Help -&gt; Tutorials -&gt; Inkscape: Advanced<br>Here we will learn about:<br>Cutting and pasting, free hand drawing, bezier curves, paths and text.<br><br>
