<h1 class="western">Unit Two -- Graphics</h1>

This unit focuses on working with images that, unlike photos, were not
created with a camera, but instead created directly on the
computer.&nbsp; These types of graphics are useful in things like
flyers, magazine covers, company logos, advertisements, or your family
christmas card.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

<br>

However, there is a very important part of graphics that this course
will only touch on a little...the artistic elements.&nbsp; To make good
graphics, you must understand what images are most pleasing to the
eye.&nbsp; Although this section will provide a few pointers along the
way, to really understand this takes several courses of study, years of
practice and a lot of hard work.&nbsp; Instead, this course will focus
on some of the basics of how graphics work, and how to use a few tools
to come up with some very basic designs.&nbsp; <br>

design, you can start by reading through these articles:<br>

<h2 class="western">Other Graphic Applications</h2>

<h3>Publishing Layout</h3>



Once you've created a great graphic, you need to find a way to display
it to the world.&nbsp; Sometimes that is done online, but often that
means printing it out.&nbsp; There are a whole class of programs that
revolve around making things look good when printed out, called Print
Layout, Page Layout, or Publishing Layout programs.&nbsp; These go
beyond the capabilities of typical word processing programs like
Microsoft Word, which are generally focused on A5 sized
documents.&nbsp; They allow you to create things like brochures,
magazines, books, flyers, etc.&nbsp; <br>


<br>


The most professional tool in this field is generally considered to be
QuarkXPress, but Adobe also has its popular PageMaker and InDesign
programs.&nbsp; In smaller companies and in personal use, tools such as
Microsoft Publisher and the open source tool <a href="http://www.scribus.net/">Scribus</a> do this
work.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

<h3>3-D Creation</h3>

In this section we only talked about creating graphics in two
dimensions, although sometimes we talked about making it look like if
it were in three dimensions.&nbsp; However, all our creations were made
to be viewed from one direction and were flat graphics (you couldn't
turn them to the side or back).&nbsp; There is also a whole segment of
graphic creation that involves creating things that are capable of
being manipulated in three dimensions.&nbsp; When you have one of these
objects, it is possible to spin it around and view it from all
angles.&nbsp; <br>

<br>

The two biggest packages for creating 3-D graphics are <a href="http://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> (open source) and Maya (proprietary).&nbsp; They are often used to create characters in movies (like Toy Story or <a href="http://www.bigbuckbunny.org/index.php/download/">Big Buck Bunny</a>), video games, or advertisements.&nbsp; (<a href="http://www.blenderguru.com/27-inspiring-blender-animations-that-will-make-your-jaw-drop/">More animations</a> with Blender)<br>

<br>

In a tangentially related category, are object creation programs.&nbsp;
These can be used to create objects for things like automated milling
or <a href="http://www.makerbot.com/">3-D printing</a>. or they can be
used to create objects for virtual worlds like Second Life or Google
Earth.&nbsp; The most popular tool that people use for creating these
objects is Google Sketchup, however, it is a simplified descendant of
industrial strength Computer Aided Design (CAD) programs such as Auto
CAD, Solidworks, and <a href="http://brlcad.org/">BRL CAD</a>.<br>

<h3>Animation and Interaction<br>
</h3>

The use of computers to view graphics over the internet has allowed
them to take on a whole new property of interactivity.&nbsp; Computer
driven graphics are capable of performing actions in response to events
by the user (clicking somewhere, pushing a key, etc) or simply based on
a timer that started when the graphic was opened.&nbsp; By far the most
common way of displaying this content on the internet is through
Adobe's Flash Player plugin for web browsers (the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnash/">Gnash</a> program is a compatible, open source version).&nbsp; <br>

<br>

Because the Flash standard is controlled by the Adobe corporation,
there have been two, somewhat joined, attempts to replace it with an
open standard in the last couple years.&nbsp; The first was to build
animation capability into the SVG format.&nbsp; This provides for some
of the basic features that the Flash standard supported.&nbsp; Beyond
that the new HTML 5 standard, which all the major browser makers have
implemented or are implementing, has numerous animation
abilities.&nbsp; It can deal with SVG files in more advanced ways, it
also has what is called a "canvas" element, which creates an area on
the page where all kinds of graphics and animation can be shown and
manipulated.<br>

<h2>Logo Exercise</h2>
<h3>Creation of your logo - Part 1</h3>
In this exercise you will need to create a logo for an imaginary company.<br>
<br>
1 - Think of your company.&nbsp; What will the comany do?&nbsp; What
will its product be?&nbsp; It must not an existing company or its
product.&nbsp; Write out your company and its products.<br>
<br>
For example: Coca-Cola is NOT acceptable, Cola de Tomas is acceptable<br>
<br>
2 - Write out a description of your logo.&nbsp; Include shapes, colors, and other important features.<br>
<h3>Creation of your logo - Part 2</h3>
Use Inkscape to create your logo based on the description in part
1.&nbsp; Along with the submission of your logo, include the text you
wrote from part 1, with any updates that are necessary.<br>
<h2>Final Exercise<br>
</h2>
In this several part exercise, we will be creating an advertisement for
the imaginary product/company you created in the Logo Exercise.&nbsp;
This advertisement should be a full-page (A5 size paper) that could go
into a magazine.&nbsp; It should include your logo from the Logo
Exercise.<br>
<h3>
Part 1</h3>

Plan the layout.&nbsp; What will the advertisement look like?&nbsp;
Will there be text, pictures, other graphics?&nbsp; How will the
components be spaced out?<br>
Write out the plan and submit it.&nbsp; If you are going to use any
external material (pictures, graphics, etc) include their attribution.<br>
<h3>
Part 2</h3>

Create your layout with Inkscape.&nbsp; Submit the SVG and a PNG export
that could be published.&nbsp; Include the original plan with any
changes that you needed to make.<br>
 
<h2>Vocabulary</h2>
Graphics - Images created without the use of a camera.<br>

Vector Graphics - A type of graphics that can be stored as instructions for re-creating the image instead of in a raster format.<br>Shape
- A object in a vector graphic.&nbsp; This can be a regular shape
(rectangle, elipse, polygon) or something irregular such as a blob.<br>

Stroke - A line.&nbsp; The most common use for strokes is to create the
outside boundary of a shape, but they can also be used by themselves
such as when drawing lines.&nbsp; The stroke can have properties such
as color or thickness.<br>

Fill - The properties of the area contained by the shape's stroke.&nbsp; The most common fill property is color.&nbsp; <br>
Z-Order - Identifies the position on the "Z" axis, which determines which objects are in front or behind other objects.<br>
Path - A sequence of lines or curves.<br>
Node - A point on a path that determines its position.&nbsp; <br>
Bezier Curve - A special type of path that allows the direction that the line takes as it goes into a node to be changed.<br>
