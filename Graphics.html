<h1 class="western">Unit Two -- Graphics</h1>
This unit focuses on working with images that unlike photos were not
created with a camera, but instead created directly on the
computer.&nbsp; These types of graphics are useful in things like
flyers, magazine covers, company logos, advertisements, or your family
christmas card.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
However, there is a very important part of graphics that this course
will only touch on a little...the artistic elements.&nbsp; To make good
graphics, you must understand what images are most pleasing to the
eye.&nbsp; Although this section will provide a few pointers along the
way, to really understand this takes several courses of study, years of
practice and a lot of hard work.&nbsp; Instead, this course will focus
on some of the basics of how graphics work, and how to use a few tools
to come up with some very basic designs.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
If you want more information about the more artistic side of graphic
design, you can start by reading through these articles:<br>

<h2 class="western">Vector Graphics</h2>
<p>Unlike raster images (photos, covered in Unit One) vector graphics
do not consist of pixels arranged on a grid with different values.
Instead vector graphics are stored as sets of instructions that a
computer can run to re-create a graphic. </p>
<p>A simplistic example of these instructions could be:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Create a circle with a center 3 units above the center, and a
radius of 2 units. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fill circle with yellow</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Create a line from 2 units below the center to 3 units above and
two units left of the center.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Create a line from 2 units below the center to 3 units above and
two units right of the center.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>If there were a program that could run this very simple script, it
might draw to the screen the following:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="VectorGraphics/SimpleScriptOutput.png" alt="SimpleScriptOutput.png"></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The good thing about this is that you'll most likely never have to
actually look at the script the computer creates, just like you never
have to look at the array of pixels and channels that are stored in a
photograph. However, if you want to get advanced, that would be
possible (and quite a bit easier than editing a raster image). Instead,
we will be using tools that convert the things we draw with
the mouse and keyboard into one of these scripts that the computer
can follow when it wants to re-produce an image to view on the screen
(the screen is really just a raster graphic viewer). Then when we
are all done, we can have it run the script again to produce another
raster graphic that can be saved into a PNG file. </p>
<p>It is also possible for this script to include a certain amount of
time to wait before something happens. This allows for animations
some simple examples would be having a stick figure move across the
image or having a ball bounce.</p>
One of the very important benefits of vector images is that all the
commands for the image are relative.&nbsp; If you need to increase the
size of the image, you just need to change the units that all the
commands are applied to.&nbsp; In the above example, one unit equals
approximately 10 pixels, but this could easily be modified so that one
pixel equals 20 pixels or even 100 pixels.&nbsp; The image would
automatically scale up to the new size without losing any quality, the
image will stay crisp and you won't see any pixel artifacts.&nbsp; This
is the opposite of how photos work, there if you were to try to scale
the photo up to double or ten times the original size, you would see
probles show up in the image.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Here is an example using our simple image.&nbsp; In each case, the
vector graphic is on the left and the raster graphic is on the right.<br>
<br>
One unit equals 10 pixels.<br>
<img src="VectorGraphics/SimpleScriptOutput.png" alt="SimpleScriptOutput.png"><img src="VectorGraphics/SimpleScriptOutput.png" alt="SimpleScriptOutput.png"> <br>
One unit equals 20 pixels.<br>
<img src="VectorGraphics/SimpleScriptOutput-Vector2.png" alt="SimpleScriptOutput-Vector2.png"><img src="VectorGraphics/SimpleScriptOutput-RasterScale2.png" alt="SimpleScriptOutput-RasterScale2.png"><br>
One unit equals 100 pixels. &nbsp; (This one is being scaled back
down&nbsp; to one unit equals 40 pixels by the web-browser to fit to
the screen, if you want to see it as full-sized right click on it and
view it seperately.)<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 400px; height: 400px;" src="VectorGraphics/SimpleScriptOutput-Vector10.png" alt="SimpleScriptOutput-Vector10.png"><img style="width: 400px; height: 400px;" src="VectorGraphics/SimpleScriptOutput-RasterScale10.png" alt="SimpleScriptOutput-RasterScale10.png"><br>
You can see that as we talked about in the photos section, the raster
graphic doesn't scale up to the large size very well.&nbsp;&nbsp;
However, the vector graphic continues to look smooth and clean at any
size.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
In addition to cleanly scaling, vector graphics usually take up less
space.&nbsp; In a raster image, data needs to be stored for every pixel
(in three or four channels).&nbsp; If you have large images, this can
be millions of bytes.&nbsp; Vector graphics on the other hand only
store the information necessary to make the shapes and color them
in.&nbsp; For the above example, this is just four commands, each one
taking only a few bytes.&nbsp; There are things you can do to make very
complicated vector graphics, but typically they will be much smaller
than their raster counterparts.<br>
<br>
The other very nice thing about vector graphics is that when you are
using graphical programs like Inkscape or Illustrator to edit them, it
is very easy to select objects.&nbsp; For photos we had some real
challanges in selecting different objects (like the airplane and the
statue's arm).&nbsp; However, since in vector graphics the commands to
create each object are stored, when you click on an object, it is easy
for the program to guess which object you are trying to select.&nbsp;
You can then easily modify that object by resizing it, rotating it, or
moving it. <br>

<br>
<h3 class="western">File Formats</h3>
<p>The primary file format currently in use is SVG or Scalable Vector
Graphics (see: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svg">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svg</a>
) which is a type of human readable file called XML. Although XML
and SVG are human-readable, we will not be reading them directly as
part of this material. SVG is supported in most vector drawing
programs, however it is not yet supported by all web browsers (though
this is rapidly changing). If you simply want to use your images on
web pages, it is best to convert them to Portable Network Graphics
(PNG) which is a lossless raster format. </p>
<p>The other major format for Vector Graphics is the EPS or
Encapsulated Post Script. Post Script itself is a file type used for
printing (especially industrial printing), and EPS images are built
to be easily put inside of a Post Script document. This format has
been around a lot longer than SVG, and is supported by many more
tools (especially the old ones). Likewise, it is not recommended for
use with web browsers.</p>
<h2 class="western">Inkscape</h2>
Inkscape will be the vector editor that we do the majority of our work
in, once we have learned the fundamentals here, we will move on to
trying the same concepts out in Adobe Illustrator, which is the other
major vector graphics editor on the market.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
To start with Inkscape, there are three interactive tutorials that are
built in to the program that are very good, and because they are
interactive, they are better than just words on paper, so instead of
reading what they have to tell you here, lets open up inkscape and give
them a try.&nbsp; <br>
<img src="VectorScreen/InkscapeStartup.png" alt="InkscapeStartup.png"><br>
Once you have Inkscape open...<br>
<br>
<h3>Inkscape Basics</h3>
Go to the menu Help -&gt; Tutorials -&gt; Inkscape: Basics.&nbsp; That
will open in a new window and you can read all about (and try out!)
panning, zooming, the tools, documents, moving, scaling, rotating,
important keys, selections, fills, strokes, duplication, layers, and
depth.<br>
<br>
Now that we have a grasp on the basics, lets go do an example.&nbsp; I
have prepared a .svg file that can be opend in inkscape with all the
material that we'll need.<br>
<a href="VectorGraphics/BasicScene-orig.svg">BasicScene-orig.svg<br>
<img style="width: 338px; height: 256px;" src="VectorGraphics/BasicScene-orig.png" alt="BasicScene-orig.png"></a><br>
In this one SVG file there is a background all setup (made up of two
parts: the foreground with all the trees, ground, and water; and the
background with the sky).&nbsp; There are also three different
components that need to be added in.&nbsp; The fire and tent need to be
scaled down and put in the empty area between the trees.&nbsp; The
mountains need to be scaled up and be put behind the ground and trees
but in front of the sky.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Here's what the finished result will look like.<br>
<img src="VectorGraphics/BasicScene-final.png" alt="BasicScene-final.png"><br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Working with Shapes</h3>
Once you've masterd those basics, we'll move on to the next tutorial:<br>
Help -&gt; Tutorials -&gt; Inkscape: Shapes<br>
Here we will learn about and try out: <br>
Rectangles (with rounding), ellipses and circles, stars and polygons,
and spirals.<br>
<br>
Now lets go and try out all the shape tools and many of their different
options.&nbsp; In one Inkscape page, draw the following.<br>
Rectangle: Filled with no stroke, stroke with no fill, fill and stroke,
rounded corners, rounded corners and edges.<br>
Ellipse: Ellipse, slice, arc.<br>
Polygon/Star: Polygon, polygon with different number of sides, star,
star with offset points, polygon with rounded corners, polygon with
randomizer.<br>
Spiral: Spiral, spiral with less turns, spiral that doesn't start from
the middle, spiral with faster divergence.<br>
<br>
Your page may look something like this:<br>
<img src="VectorGraphics/BasicShapes-final.png" alt="BasicShapes-final.png"><br>
<br>
<h3>Paths and Text</h3>
Finally, we have one last tutorial that introduces some of the most
important concepts:<br>
Help -&gt; Tutorials -&gt; Inkscape: Advanced<br>
Here we will learn about:<br>
Cutting and pasting, free hand drawing, bezier curves, paths and text.<br>
<br>
One of the most important parts of this section is working with bezier
curves.&nbsp; To get a little practice, we're going to turn a simple
rectangle into a piece of paper that is starting to curl
up.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here's what the end result will look like:<br>
<img src="VectorGraphics/BezierRectangle-final.png" alt="BezierRectangle-final.png"><br>
<br>
First, download the <a href="VectorGraphics/BezierRectangle-orig.svg">.svg
file</a> of the starting rectangle.<br>
<br>
You'll notice that there are a couple of handy nodes about half way
down the sides of the rectangle. Let's go ahead and pull both of those
nodes to the right (using the node-editing mode).&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Once we've got them out there, we will add some bezier curves into the
strait lines.&nbsp; To do this, hold down shift as you click on one of
the nodes, and drag out from it.&nbsp; That should create a handle for
the curve coming out of that point.&nbsp; Go ahead and do that for both
sides of the middle points, and then also to the lines coming down from
the two top points.<br>
<br>
Once we've got the paper gently curling, lets add some example
text.&nbsp; To do that, we'll switch to the text tool.&nbsp; Then click
near the center of the paper and type whatever text you want to
see.&nbsp; You can change the font size, centering, and font to make it
look any way you like.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Using&nbsp; Proportions and Space<br>
</h3>
One of the most important things to think about when creating graphics
is if the proportions between the various components of your graphic
are correct.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
The most important aspect of proportion is when you are working with a
graphic that shows an image of a 3-Dimensional scene (such as the
campsite example used above).&nbsp; When creating a 3-D scene in two
dimensions (on the computer screen, or paper) you as the artist need to
make sure that the correct proportions are used to accurately represnt
the scene.&nbsp; Not accurately re-creating it will cause the people
viewing the work to sense that something isn't correct, often without
being able to actually identify it, which will lead them to not enjoy
the work.&nbsp; The best way to think about proportion of 3-D works is
the understand that things look bigger when they are closer.&nbsp; When
you are putting together a scene in inkscape, it is easy to re-size the
objects you are working with.&nbsp; So use this ability to increase the
size of close objects and to shrink the size of distant objects, so
that they look natural.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
If you look closely at the example of the campground we used above,
you'll notice that the trees are smaller in the distance and larger up
close.&nbsp; This was done by using the same tree object, and simply
changing the size to match what was needed.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Lets try that same example now.&nbsp; Here is the original file, with
just the background and example trees.&nbsp; Copy and paste the trees
into the background and change their size to match the correct
proportion.&nbsp; Start in the back with the small trees, then move
forward with increasingly large trees.&nbsp; Don't forget to leave an
open area for our campsite.<br>
<br>
<a href="VectorGraphics/Background-Empty.svg">Background-Empty.svg<br>
<img style="width: 506px; height: 373px;" src="VectorGraphics/Background-Empty.png" alt="Background-Empty.png"></a><br>
<br>
The other main aspect of proportion is in a non-3-D scene.&nbsp; When
you simply have text and graphics you need to be aware of the relative
sizes between the different objects.&nbsp; Also, the amount (and
location) of open space in the image is very important.<br>
<br>
The most common rule used for determinining the relative sizes of
objects and space is called the Golden Rule or Fibonacci
Sequence.&nbsp; This was developed by the mathematician from Piza named
Fibonacci.&nbsp; His sequence is simply made where the next number in
the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers.&nbsp; Starting
from 0:1 the start of the sequence is 0:1:1:2:3:5:8:13:21
etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the years scientists and artists have found that
this sequence is everywhere in nature from snail shells to tree
leaves.&nbsp; In addition, the human eye has developed over thounds of
years to readily identify this, and objects in that sequence
soothing.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
In this example on the left the sizes of the text and the spacing
between them both follow the 1:1:2:3 ratio.&nbsp; In this case the font is 20:20:40:60 and the spacing is 46:92:138.&nbsp; In the other example,
on the right, the size of the font simply has 20 added each time 20:40:60:80.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may notice that the one on the left, following the Fibonacci sequence, seems to follow a more natural progression extending up whereas the one on the right seems more abrupt.&nbsp; <br>
