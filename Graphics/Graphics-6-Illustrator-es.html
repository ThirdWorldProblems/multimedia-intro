<h2 class="western">Illustrator</h2>

Just as Photoshop has much in common with the GIMP, Illustrator has
much in common with Inkscape.&nbsp; There are a few things that work
better in one or the other, but all the important features are very
similar.&nbsp; <br>

<br>

Unlike Photoshop, you do not right-click on the items in the toolbox
(the ones with a small triangle in the lower right corner) to pop up
the other tools.&nbsp; Instead, you left click and hold down.&nbsp;
After enough time passes, the other tool options will come up.<br>

<br>

<h3>
Lines</h3>

<br>

The Pen tool works exactly the same as Inkscape's Bezier tool.&nbsp;
When you click at a new point it makes a strait line, if you then drag
it will manipulate the handles to curve it.&nbsp; <br>

<br>

The pencil tool is also similar to the freehand lines too, in that you
just click and hold the mouse, and the line follows it wherever it
goes.&nbsp; However, the one in Illustrator is somewhat different
because it will automatically make the line into a bezier curve by
adding all the necessary nodes and putting their handles at the correct
settings.&nbsp; <br>

<br>

What the pencil tool doesn't do however, is make strait lines.&nbsp; In
Inkscape you can use it by clicking in one point (and letting go of the
mouse button), then going to a different point on the screen and click
again.&nbsp; Inkscape with create one solid, strait line between
them.&nbsp; To do this in Illustrator you need to use the line segment
tool.&nbsp; With the line segment tool, you click your start location
and hold the mouse button down while you move to the finish location.<br>

<h3>
Shapes</h3>

Illustrator has the same standard shapes (Rectangle, Ellipse, Polygon,
Star, Spiral) as Inkscape.&nbsp; The only real differences is that to
get a square with rounded edges you use a separate tool, also for the
arc you use a separate arc tool instead of just making a segment of an
ellipse.<br>

<br>

<h3>Stroke and Fill</h3>

The concepts behind stroke and fill in Illustrator are the same as in
Inkscape, however, here the tools are somewhat different.&nbsp; <br>

<br>

Here we have the stroke dialog open, and are changing its thickness. <br>

<br>

To quickly change the fill (or the color of the stroke) you can click
on the color chooser in the toolbox and it will open the colors dialog.<br>

<br>

You can switch back and fourth from fill to stroke by clicking the two
overlapping boxes.&nbsp; Then pick the color for each.<br>

<br>

If you don't want to have a fill or stroke, select the white space with
the red, diagonal line through it.&nbsp; This indicates none.<br>

<br>

Just like with the GIMP and Photoshop, you will find that Inkscape and
Illustrator have a ton in common, and you can easily apply your
Inkscape skills if you ever have to sit down and work at a computer
with only Illustrator. (or you could just install Inkscape!)<br>
